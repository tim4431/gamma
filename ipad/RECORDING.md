# Phase 3 recording integration

## Use

Open a Gamma PDF and tap the microphone in the reader toolbar.

- **Start recording** asks for microphone permission, then starts native AVAudioRecorder capture. A red indicator and audio-clock timer remain in the toolbar.
- **Pause / Continue / Stop** operate on one Gamma recording session. Pause finalizes the current file; Continue creates another immutable segment.
- Continuous capture rolls over about every five minutes. This limits the open-file recovery window; it is not a claim of gapless encoding.
- Leaving the document, backgrounding the app, an audio interruption or an input-route change stops/finalizes the active segment. Resume is explicit; background/lock-screen continuous recording is not enabled in this version.
- **Play** plays the session's finalized segments in order. **Stop playback** stops it. Audio is not synchronized to Pencil strokes in Phase 3.
- If the app was killed while a segment was open, **Recover** attempts to decode it fully. **Keep finalized audio** explicitly excludes the incomplete segment while retaining its local file. A failed local metadata save remains retryable and blocks navigation/sign-out.

## Gamma model and persistence

One recording is a normal `audio` block under the existing Gamma PDF page. Its `content` is an editable note; its properties contain the audio revision, state, measured total duration and ordered segment references. Web Notes provide HTML audio controls for the same uploaded segments.

Each account-scoped page cache atomically stores `recordings` metadata with its pending `.audio` mutation. Segment files live at `GammaCache/<account>/audio/<recording UUID>/<segment UUID>.m4a`. The active segment identity is persisted before starting capture; only validated finalized segments are uploaded. Network retries keep the recording and segment UUIDs. Backend conditional revisions protect against overwriting concurrent changes; explicit conflict choices are available in recording controls.

Audio assets use the existing private `/api/assets` system (`audio/mp4`, `.m4a`, maximum 32MiB). The audio block is saved through `PUT /api/blocks/{UUID}/audio`; exact retries are idempotent. Backup/import/orphan handling includes audio. Passwords are not stored, and microphone capture never auto-starts after relaunch or permission completion in the background.

## Verification and remaining limits

- Production controller/UI compiled on Xcode 26.6 with a microphone usage description; no replay or stroke timestamp feature was added.
- `RecordingIntegration-2.xcresult`: 10 targeted tests passed (production recording cache/recovery + existing workspace + synthetic AAC codec checks).
- `AudioLive-1.xcresult`: real backend test passed using simulator-generated AAC data, production audio outbox upload, two segment assets, server-derived offsets, duplicate request handling and cache reopen. No mocked backend responses; test-only loopback bridge, not public TLS deployment.
- Backend targeted audio/ink tests: 18 passed; backend Ruff passed. Frontend: 48 tests passed and build succeeded.
- A prior lint check found two small Python style errors; fixed before deployment.
- Full AAC recovery scanning initially failed by reading beyond logical EOF. Bounded reads fixed it; `RecordingFinal-2.xcresult` passed all four production recording tests, including recovery and failed-write retry. Native AVAudioRecorder/Player callbacks hop explicitly to the main actor.

These are historical focused results; see [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for portable acceptance instructions and the latest summarized regression. Simulator tests and successful builds do not establish physical microphone acceptance.

**Not yet hardware-validated:** real microphone quality/permission dialogs, long recording/thermal behavior, actual phone-call interruptions, Bluetooth transitions, real disk-full events or rollover gaps. Synthetic audio/file tests do not establish those behaviors. No new GitHub release or source push was performed.
