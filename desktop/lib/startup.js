// Why opening a server failed, in words a user can act on.
//
// A sidecar that dies during startup used to reach the launcher as a raw tail
// of its log — and since the log file is appended to across runs, that tail was
// usually a dozen irrelevant INFO lines from the last good run with the real
// cause somewhere below. This module answers two questions instead: what
// happened (one sentence plus the server's own wording) and what would fix it
// (`action`, which the launcher turns into a button).

const fs = require('fs');

// `from` is the byte offset the failing run's header was written at, so only
// this run's lines are read back.
function logTail(logPath, from = 0, lines = 60) {
  try {
    const buf = fs.readFileSync(logPath);
    const text = buf.subarray(Math.min(from, buf.length)).toString('utf8');
    return text.split(/\r?\n/).filter((l) => l.trim()).slice(-lines).join('\n') || '(no output)';
  } catch {
    return '(no log)';
  }
}

// First rule whose pattern appears in the log wins; the matched line is kept as
// `detail` so the server still speaks for itself.
