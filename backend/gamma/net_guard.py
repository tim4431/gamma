"""Outbound-fetch safety: block SSRF to internal/loopback/metadata hosts and
non-HTTP schemes.

Every server-side fetch of a user-supplied URL (the PDF proxy, PDF resolution,
the AI PDF re-download) must go through :func:`guarded_urlopen` so an attacker
can't turn the server into a request forwarder for ``file://`` reads,
``http://127.0.0.1`` / ``169.254.169.254`` probes, or reaching private-network
services the box can see but the internet can't.

Note on DNS rebinding: we resolve the host and reject internal addresses before
connecting, and we re-validate on every redirect, but a hostname that resolves
public here and private at connect time is a residual risk. Pair this with an
egress firewall for defense in depth.
