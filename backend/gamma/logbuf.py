"""In-memory server log behind Settings → Diagnostics → "Server log".

Everything the backend logs through the shared `log` logger (plus uvicorn's
error/traceback logger) is scrubbed for secret-shaped substrings and kept in a
bounded ring buffer; admins read it via GET /api/admin/logs. Console output is
unchanged — the buffer is a debugging window, not an audit trail, and holds
nothing across restarts.

Scrubbing happens at insert time so a secret never sits in the buffer or
crosses the wire. The one deliberate exception lives in seed.py: the one-time
seeded admin password is a raw print() and must never be routed through here.
