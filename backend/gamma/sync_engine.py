"""Mirrors: a local workspace kept in step with a workspace on another Gamma
server (docs/dev/mirror.md).

The remote is the authority. One round (``sync_workspace``) asks both
change feeds (``/api/sync/changes``, local and remote) which pages moved,
then reconciles each page three ways from the tree it held at the last
round (``sync_pages.base``):

- remote-only change: the remote's diff is applied locally;
- local-only change: the local diff is pushed, with ``base`` texts so the
  remote merges against anything that landed there meanwhile;
- both: the remote diff is applied locally first (the local server's own
  three-way text merge keeps the local keystrokes), then what still differs
  is pushed, the remote tree is fetched back and becomes the new base.

An edit beats a delete, in both directions: a subtree the remote deleted
stays when it was edited here (and is re-inserted there by the push), and
a subtree deleted here comes back when the remote edited inside it. Every
such decision and every text merge that changed a block is a row of
``sync_conflicts`` for the person to look at; sync never blocks on one.
Pages deleted on one side and untouched on the other are deleted on the
other; deleted-and-edited pages come back.

Files travel by content hash: uploads a page references are fetched when
missing here and uploaded when missing there, so a re-run never duplicates.

A mirror may carry a page filter (``page_filter``, a list of page ids; NULL
= every page): a round then looks only at those pages, in both feeds, moves
only their files, and a page outside it never travels either way. A listed
page with no saved base is "new" whatever the feeds say, which is how a page
added to the filter goes over at the next round. Publishing a page to the
share host is such a filtered mirror (gamma/publish.py).

Writes on the remote carry the mirror's write-scope integration token
(``Authorization: Bearer``), so they land under the account that made the
mirror. Local writes go through ``commit_ops`` with client ``"sync"``, which
is how the local change feed's re-listing of them costs nothing (they diff
to no-op) and how the page's live viewers see them arrive.
