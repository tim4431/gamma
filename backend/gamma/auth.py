"""Session middleware and request → identity / workspace resolution.

Two questions every endpoint answers through this module:

- WHO is asking — ``request.state.user`` from the session cookie
  (``require_user`` for identity-only endpoints: session, AI keys, admin).
- WHICH WORKSPACE the data comes from — ``require_ws`` (session member of
  the workspace named by ``?ws=`` / ``X-Gamma-Workspace`` / the account's
  default), ``resolve_ws`` (a ``?share=`` token's workspace, else
  ``require_ws``) and ``require_ws_writer`` (an edit share, else a member
  with the editor or owner role). The returned id is what every data helper
  takes (``connect_pages_db``, ``ws_uploads_dir``, ...). docs/dev/workspaces.md.
