"""The per-document manifest: what the viewer needs to lay a PDF out before
pdf.js has parsed a byte — its size in bytes, page count, and every page's
size in points — derived once per stored file into the workspace's
``data.db`` (``pdf_docs``), next to the other derived per-document data (the
PDF text index). Read by ``GET /api/pdf-info/{doc_id}``; the viewer lays out
its page boxes from it while the bytes are still arriving, and picks the
transport (one download or range requests) from the byte size
(docs/dev/pdf_loading.md).

Computed on a background thread when a PDF is stored (``schedule``), by the
search indexer when it walks a document anyway, and on demand by the
endpoint for anything that predates the table. A file pdfium cannot read is
stored with ``pages = 0`` so it is not parsed again on every open. Rows of
documents no page carries any more are purged with the text index
(``pdf_index.purge_unused``)."""
