"""SQLite helpers: schemas, connections, workspace paths, prefs, timestamps.

Two kinds of database (docs/dev/user_db.md):

- ``users.db`` — global: accounts, sessions, workspaces + memberships, page
  shares, personal prefs, server settings. Its ``PRAGMA user_version`` is
  the data directory's schema version (``SCHEMA_VERSION``); a data
  directory behind it is upgraded by ``gamma/migrations.py`` before the
  server serves anything, one ahead of it is refused.
- per workspace, under ``workspaces/<id>/``: ``pages.db`` (the block tree
  + op log) and ``data.db`` (chats, cover snapshots, the search indexes).
  These files carry no version: their statements are ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`` applied on every connect, and a restored backup is normalized
  by ``gamma/normalize.py`` when it is imported.

``USERS_SCHEMA`` is always the CURRENT shape. Older shapes are not patched
here on connect — that is what the numbered migration steps are for.
