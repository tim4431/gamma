"""Block operations — THE write path for a page's blocks.

A page's notes change through small, typed operations rather than a whole-
tree replace, so several clients (two browsers of one account, share editors)
can edit one page at once and only the touched rows move:

- ``set {id, content?, base?, props?}`` — ``content`` replaces the text;
  with ``base`` (the text the client's change was computed from) it is
  applied as a patch when the block changed meanwhile, so two people
  editing different spans of one block both keep their edit
  (gamma/textmerge.py; the applied op carries the merged text). ``props``
  is a PATCH (``{key: value | null}``, null deletes), so unrelated
  properties never conflict (Figma's property-level rule).
- ``insert {id, parent, position?, content, props}`` — the client mints the
  id and the fractional position; a position that collides with a sibling is
  re-keyed here and the applied op carries the final value. Re-inserting a
  known id (a retried batch) is a move + set, never an error.
- ``move {id, parent, position?}`` — cycle-checked, same collision rule.
- ``delete {id}`` — the subtree.

Every touched block (and every insert parent) must be inside the page; the
page root may only be ``set`` (a share editor: content only — rename — never
its properties), never moved or deleted. Only touched rows get
``updated_at``; the page root is stamped once per batch (home-feed order,
the notes index fingerprint). One batch is one transaction and one row of
the per-page op log (``page_ops``, ``seq`` counting up per page) — live
clients follow the log over the page's websocket (gamma/collab.py), a
reconnecting one reads it back with ``ops_since``.

``ws`` everywhere below is the workspace id (docs/dev/workspaces.md), ``actor``
the account making the change. Server-side writers (the block endpoints, AI
tools, page rename/attach, metadata) go through ``apply_ops`` too, so everything a page's viewers see
comes from one code path and one log.
