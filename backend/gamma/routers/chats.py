"""Per-page AI chat-history persistence.

Bucket keys are the focused page's block id, "home" (the library-root chat),
or "home:<folder path>" (per-folder chats — one conversation per folder view).
Folder paths nest on "/", so the key routes use the :path converter (uvicorn
decodes %2F before routing, a plain {block_id} would 404 on nested folders).
