"""Page-first endpoints (/api/pages*): create a page, attach or detach its
PDF. Stage 1 of docs/dev/block_centric.md — a page is a root block that may
CARRY a PDF; the PDF is an action on an existing page, not the way pages come
into being. (``POST /api/blocks/by-doc/{doc_id}`` remains the lookup-or-create
BY ATTACHMENT path for PDF ingest and the extension's dedup.)

All three need an editor of the workspace (``require_ws(write=True)``): a share token never creates
pages or changes a page's attachment (page properties stay the owner's, same
rule as PUT /blocks/{id} under a share).
