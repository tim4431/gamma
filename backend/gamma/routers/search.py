"""Library-wide full-text search: notes (block_fts) and PDF contents (pdf_fts).

Both indexes are SQLite FTS5 tables in the per-user data.db. The PDF one is
built here: each paper's text is extracted once, so searching ~1000 papers is
a millisecond-range query instead of opening a thousand PDFs; missing papers
are indexed lazily by a background thread the first time a search runs, and
the response reports how many are still pending so the UI can hint that
results are incomplete. The notes index lives in gamma.block_index (rebuilt
per page, synchronously, when a page changed since its last build).

Extraction prefers pypdfium2 (PDFium — proper word spacing and unicode) and
falls back to PyPDF2. Text is stored in normalized form (see gamma.textnorm)
so queries like "3000" hit "3,000-qubit"; queries are normalized the same way
at search time. Bumping textnorm.INDEX_VERSION re-indexes everything lazily.

Positions are deliberately NOT stored here: the frontend re-finds the matched
text with pdf.js (the engine that renders the page) when a hit is opened, so
highlight rects always agree with what's on screen.

``GET /api/search`` is the one endpoint over both indexes (hits carry
``source: "notes" | "pdf"``); ``/pdf-search`` is the PDF-only predecessor the
frontend still uses.
