"""The workspace change feed: what changed since a cursor, for anything that
keeps a copy of a workspace in step (a desktop mirror, a backup merge).

``GET /api/sync/changes?since=&limit=`` lists the pages whose root block was
stamped after the cursor (every writer stamps the page root once per batch:
``apply_ops``, ``record_ops``, ``log_reload``, the raw import paths) and the
``deleted_pages`` tombstones written after it, as one stream ordered by
time. The feed is a HINT, not the truth: a page's own op log (``seq``,
``GET /pages/{id}/ops?since=``) says what actually changed, and the
consumer must be idempotent, because

- pagination re-lists nothing (the cursor is ``<time>|<id>``, strict), but
- a caught-up answer's cursor is moved back by ``GRACE_SECONDS``: a writer
  that computed its timestamp before another one committed (an import
  holds one ``now`` for its whole run) would otherwise slip behind a cursor
  taken between the two, so the last minute is re-listed on every poll.

Members read it (viewers too); share links do not.
