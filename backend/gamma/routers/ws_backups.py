"""Per-workspace backups (/api/workspaces/{ws}/backups*): the snapshots
Settings → Backups manages — take one, list, download, restore in place,
delete. The zip and the restore live in gamma/ws_backup.py; this is the
HTTP skin plus who-may-do-what: any member (or admin) lists and downloads,
an owner takes, restores and deletes (a merge restore needs an editor, like
/api/import-data). A guest's workspace keeps no snapshots and takes no
restore — it goes away with the guest (docs/dev/guests.md).
