"""Workspaces API (/api/workspaces*): create, inspect, rename, access,
quota, kind, default, delete, members, and invitations by Gamma Cloud
username (pending memberships, claimed on the person's first sign-in).

The model and its rules live in gamma/workspaces.py; this is the HTTP skin.
Anyone creates personal workspaces for themselves; server admins create
shared ones (for any owner) and set access, quota and kind. Owner-only
operations (rename, delete, members) also pass for admins, who need no
membership (a lab workspace whose last owner left can be recovered, and
Settings → Workspaces manages every workspace from one place).
