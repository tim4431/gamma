"""Agent tools for the AI chat — a scope-agnostic tool registry.

Every chat has a *scope* deciding what its tools can touch:

- ``{"type": "folder", "folder": path}`` — the home/folder chat; tools reach
  the pages in that folder ("" = the whole library).
- ``{"type": "page", "page_id": id}`` — the per-page chat; tools reach only
  that page.

``context_pages`` extends either scope for reads; mutations keep the base scope.

Each TOOLS entry declares its wire spec, the Settings permission key
(Settings → Assistant → Folder agent), the scopes it exists in, whether it
mutates, and its executor — so arming a chat is one filter
(:func:`agent_tools`) and dispatch is one lookup (:func:`run_agent_tool`),
with the in-scope check shared by every executor.

Reads: list the pages (folder scope only); read a page (its notes and
highlights, plus the extracted text of its PDF attachment when it has one);
read a page's note outline with block ids; full-text-search the reachable
pages' notes and PDF text via the two FTS indexes; search the scholarly record
and read a document that is not in the library (``ai_web.py`` — read-only,
nothing stored).  Writes: rename pages and
file them into (sub)folders (folder scope only); edit, create and move note
blocks (both scopes, under their own permission).  Deliberately NOT offered
under any permission: deleting anything, rewriting flat labels, or touching
pages outside the scope — and every successful call is streamed back to the
UI as an ``action`` event so the user sees exactly what the agent did.  The
human-facing description lives in ``docs/dev/ai_tools.md``; the base role
prompt (AGENT_PROMPT) is user-editable in the prompt editor, the
scope/permission lines are appended mechanically.  Renamed tools stay
callable under their old name (``ai_context.DEPRECATED_TOOLS``) so saved
chats replay.

Folder semantics mirror ``frontend/src/library/libraryUtils.js``: ``properties.folder``
is a comma-separated list of ``/``-nested paths, folders exist only through the
tags in use, and ``properties.category`` holds the flat labels.

    "page may be in several folders) and flat labels; folders appear the moment a "
    "page is filed into them. Never guess page ids. Use the reading tools to answer "
    "questions about the pages themselves — their notes as much as their PDFs — "
    "e.g. to compare papers or write a summary; cite a PDF by its page number and "
    "say when something comes from the user's own notes. When asked to organize, "
    "apply an explicit bulk instruction (e.g. a naming scheme) to every matching "
    "page without asking again; ask first when the request is ambiguous. You "
    "cannot delete anything or edit labels. After making changes, finish with a "
    "short summary of what you changed. Your earlier tool calls and their results "
    "stay in this conversation so you remember what you already listed, read and "
    "changed — but they are snapshots from earlier turns: the user edits their "
    "notes between messages, and your own edits change what read_block returns. "
    "When the user asks you to read, look at, check, show or quote something, or "
    "before you edit a block, call the tool again and answer from that fresh "
    "result — never from an earlier turn's output. Reuse old results only for "
