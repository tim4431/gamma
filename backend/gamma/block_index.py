"""Full-text index over note blocks — ``block_fts`` in the per-user data.db,
next to the PDF index (``pdf_fts``, routers/search.py).

Every non-root block's content is indexed under its page root (highlights
included — their note text is a note like any other; the quoted PDF passage
is already in ``pdf_fts``). Text is stored normalized (gamma.textnorm — the
same rules and INDEX_VERSION as the PDF index) so one query matches both.

The index is built lazily and per page, like the PDF one: ``refresh()`` runs
before a search and rebuilds only the pages whose bookkeeping row
(``block_fts_meta``) is missing, stale (older INDEX_VERSION) or no longer
matches the page root's ``updated_at``. That fingerprint covers every write
that touches the page root (the editor's PUT /children, imports, the agent
tools, clips); the block endpoints that change a child without touching the
root (POST/PUT/DELETE /blocks/{id}, reorder) call ``mark_page_dirty`` — the
invalidation is "forget the page's row", the next search rebuilds it. Pages
are small, so a rebuild is one subtree read + one insert; a first-ever
search over a big library rebuilds in batches (``REFRESH_BATCH`` pages per
request) and reports the remainder as still indexing.

No positions are stored: the frontend re-finds the match in the block text.
