# Research notes

Findings, not tasks: how other products solve a problem, what was learned
from Gamma's own code before a redesign, and the reasoning behind the
design that was picked. Read these when a similar decision comes up again;
the current mechanics live in [docs/dev/](../dev/), which these notes never
duplicate.

| Note | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| [demo-production.md](demo-production.md) | How scripted demos and screen-recording editors achieve smooth motion, readable framing and repeatable exports; animated WebP delivery measured on Gamma's refreshed demos. |
| [handwriting-interactions.md](handwriting-interactions.md) | How Goodnotes and Notability select, edit, transform and reuse ink; finger taps versus holds; contextual menus; the broader writing/study feature inventory; Gamma gaps and acceptance criteria. |
| [collaboration.md](collaboration.md) | How real-time collaborative editing is built elsewhere (OT, record-level last-writer-wins, CRDTs), why a snapshot autosave cannot collaborate, and why Gamma took the Notion / Linear / Figma shape. |
| [workspaces.md](workspaces.md) | What happens when identity and data location are one string, what a workspace model needs, and how to version a data directory so upgrades stay safe and steps do not pile up. |
| [handwriting.md](handwriting.md) | Which ink formats exist (InkML, Xournal++, PDF `/Ink`, tldraw, Excalidraw, reMarkable, PencilKit) and which are worth speaking, what stylus input the browser gives on each platform, what the upstream fork's native-iPad handwriting taught, and how Notability's pen, highlighter, eraser and lasso are set up. |
| [obsidian.md](obsidian.md) | What an Obsidian vault is (files, wikilinks, embeds, block ids, callouts, properties, tags), how the official Importer maps Notion and Logseq into it, what an export from another app is expected to look like, and the mapping Gamma's vault import/export chose. |
| [pdf_loading.md](pdf_loading.md) | Where a cold PDF open spends its time, the five moves the upstream fork made (range transport, server page sizes, server previews, keeping parsed documents, MRC flattening) with their measurements, which of them fit Gamma's workspace and derived-data model, the path chosen, and what measuring found that the survey had not (the worker script re-downloaded on every open). |
| [latex-editing.md](latex-editing.md) | How LaTeX Workshop, Obsidian's LaTeX Suite and Overleaf complete `\commands` (fuzzy ranking, `@`/typed shorthands, snippet slots) and place their equation previews (hover with a caret marker, a strip anchored to the equation), and which of those Gamma's completion tiers, abbreviation table and docked preview took. |
| [onboarding.md](onboarding.md) | How VS Code walkthroughs, Notion, Linear, Figma, Logseq, Readwise Reader and the tour libraries onboard a first user (content, task-driven tours, checklists, coach marks), why tours rot (selectors), and which pieces Gamma's guide took. |
| [website.md](website.md) | What thirteen note and reading apps (Obsidian, Zotero, Readwise, Paperpile, Joplin, …) put on their front page, which patterns recur and which are optional, and the section order and tone gammapdf.com took from them. |
| [upstream-features.md](upstream-features.md) | What the upstream fork (`amogadget/Gamma`) built that this one had not as of September 2026 (native iPad app, offline downloads, audio-synced note replay, recording blocks, durable offline edits, model-catalog refresh, server previews, MRC flattening), ranked, with what was already here or done differently and what to revisit. |
| [hosting.md](hosting.md) | What running Gamma as a multi-tenant service with open registration would take: where the code assumes one machine (local uploads, per-workspace SQLite, in-process rooms, native sync work), the sharded-SQLite-plus-R2 shape picked over Supabase Postgres, R2 as a cache-backed primary and a two-layer backup target, and the registration, limit, abuse and operations gaps. |
| [keyboard-shortcuts.md](keyboard-shortcuts.md) | What VS Code, Obsidian, Logseq and Notion bind for line and block operations, palettes and renaming, which chords a browser keeps for itself, what CodeMirror's default keymap had been doing in the block editor, and why Gamma treats the block as the line, reads physical keys and stores rebindings in the profile |
