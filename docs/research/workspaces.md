# Workspaces and versioned data migrations

Findings from 2026-09, when Gamma separated *accounts* from *libraries* and
gave its data directory a schema version. The resulting mechanics are in
[dev/workspaces.md](../dev/workspaces.md) and
[dev/migrations.md](../dev/migrations.md); this note keeps the diagnosis and
the design reasoning, which apply to any per-user-directory application
that grows sharing.

## What was found: identity and data location were one string

Every data helper took the username: connecting to a user's database,
finding their uploads directory, committing ops. Shares and collaboration
rooms were keyed by `(username, page)`. The per-user directory held pages,
chats, preferences *and* the AI credentials side by side. Consequences:

- Renaming an account meant moving a directory, which on Windows means
  stopping the server (open SQLite handles lock the files).
- A library could not be shared, only a page: there was no object between
  "an account" and "a page" to attach membership to.
- Personal secrets and shareable content lived in the same file set, so any
  future sharing of the directory would have leaked the secrets.
- Schema changes were lazy `ALTER TABLE` statements executed on every
  connect plus one normalisation pass, with at least one step ("drop
  `shares.doc_id`") parked as *hand-run later* because an older binary would
  have broken on the new shape. That is exactly how migration debt piles up:
  every connect re-checks every historical patch, and nothing can ever be
  removed because nothing records which patches a directory has had.

## Design guidance drawn from it

**A storage location should be named by a random id, never by a
human-editable name.** With `workspaces/<id>/` a rename changes one row;
files never move. The same rule already held for uploads (content-hash
names) and pages (client-minted ids); accounts were the exception, until
schema version 25 keyed them by an id too ([data-model.md](data-model.md)).

**Introduce the object people actually share.** A *workspace* (a library:
pages, files, chats, search indexes) sits between account and page. Every
account owns a personal one it can never leave, so the old single-library
behaviour is the default and clients that name no workspace keep working.
Membership carries a role (owner / editor / viewer), invitations are by
account (Notion's model), and page share links stay the way to admit
outsiders, so nothing has to be public.

**Decide where each kind of state lives by who may see it.** Chats and
cover snapshots name the workspace's pages, so they are workspace data and
visible to its members; appearance, the AI provider choice and credentials
follow the account. Per-account browser state that names pages (tabs,
recents, reading positions) is keyed by account *and* workspace.

**Money follows the creator — revised: only personal libraries are
billed.** The first cut charged uploads into a shared workspace to its
creator's quota, so sharing would not multiply allowances. In use it
punished the one person who set the lab up, moved silently when that
person stepped down as owner, and made "how much may this workspace hold"
a question about a person. The rule now: a person's quota covers exactly
their personal workspace, and a shared workspace carries its own optional
cap that an admin sets. Two independent numbers, each about the thing it
limits.

**Personal and shared are different things, and users only make the
first.** The second cut let anyone create a shared workspace and invite
people, with an admin-set quota per workspace. That reopened the quota
question from the other side: a user could park uploads in a solo "shared"
workspace with no cap. Making the kind explicit closes it — a personal
workspace (any number per account: work, life, play) is always just its
owner and always metered against them; a shared workspace is made by an
admin, who is the one who can decide a group deserves storage of its own.
The default workspace survives only as a pointer among the personal ones.

**Public is a server-level decision.** Workspaces started with nothing
public, page share links covering outsiders. A lab wants a reading room
every member of the server sees without an invitation each; that is a
`public` access setting with a default role, granted implicitly (no join
step, nothing to leave) and set only by admins — an owner cannot expose a
library to the whole server on their own.

**Switch by full reload.** Every piece of per-library client state (open
tabs, recents, the live collaboration session) belongs to the library being
left. A navigation tears it all down for free and nothing can leak across;
cross-workspace views would have had to solve that state by state.

## Versioning a data directory

The migration design follows from the pile-up observed above.

- **One version for the whole directory**, stored in the central database
  (`PRAGMA user_version`), not one per file: the per-workspace files can be
  restored from backups older than any step, so they are normalised on
  restore instead of versioned. Revised in 2026-10 (schema version 34):
  each workspace's `pages.db` now carries its own stamp as well, so its
  steps run when it is first opened or a background walk reaches it, not
  before the server starts, and a restored copy below the base stamp is
  normalised to the base first, then runs the steps above it
  ([scaling.md](scaling.md) item 10).
- **The schema module always describes the current shape.** A fresh install
  and an upgraded one must be identical, and nothing may be patched lazily
  on connect. A release that changes a shape ships one numbered,
  re-runnable step and bumps the version, never one without the other.
- **Refuse rather than best-effort.** A directory newer than the binary is
  an error at startup; an older binary that silently opened a migrated
  directory would create empty accounts next to the moved data. A directory
  too old for the retained steps is also refused, with the message naming
  the release that still has them, which is what lets old steps be deleted.
- **Snapshot, then step, then stamp.** Databases are copied with SQLite's
  backup API before the first pending step; uploads are *moved* by rename,
  never rewritten, so a rollback is a copy-back plus the manifest. Stamping
  after each step makes an interrupted upgrade resume where it stopped.
- **Rehearse on real data.** The move was run on a copy of the production
  directory (seven accounts, a few hundred megabytes) before shipping; the
  second run had to be a no-op. Synthetic fixtures do not find the odd
  share row or the account with no uploads directory.

## Why not the alternatives

- *Keep the username as the key and add a `members` table:* renames still
  move files and shared content still sits next to personal secrets.
- *One workspace = one account, sharing by inviting into the account:*
  no roles, no way to leave, and credentials shared with the library.
- *Per-file schema versions:* restore semantics become "which files are at
  which version", and every step must handle every combination. (Adopted
  later for the workspace files, with the base stamp bounding the
  combinations; see above.)
- *Keep lazy `ALTER`s but add a version check:* the check adds nothing
  unless the patches can also be removed, which needs the numbered-step
  structure anyway.
