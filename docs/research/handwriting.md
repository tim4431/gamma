# Handwriting (ink) annotation: formats, input, and what the fork did

For the broader interaction survey—finger selection, contextual edit menus,
transforms, correction gestures and study tools—see
[handwriting-interactions.md](handwriting-interactions.md). That follow-up
distinguishes current documented behavior and platform limits from the
historical format/input findings below.

Survey from 2026-09-13, before the handwriting feature described in
[dev/handwriting.md](../dev/handwriting.md) was designed. Three questions:
which ink formats exist and which are worth speaking, what stylus input the
browser gives on each platform, and what the upstream fork's iPad-based
implementation taught. Findings only; the chosen mechanics live in the dev
doc.

## Ink formats in the wild

| Format | Who writes it | Shape | Pressure / tilt / time | Verdict for Gamma |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **InkML** (W3C Recommendation, 2011) | Handwriting-recognition toolchains, some Microsoft/Samsung pipelines; no consumer note app | XML: `<trace>` = one stroke as a list of samples; `<traceFormat>` declares the *channels* per sample (`X Y F T`, tilt `OTx OTy`, colour, width); `<brush>`, `<context>`, `<traceGroup>` | All, as declared channels | Nothing produces or consumes it in a workflow Gamma's users have. Its one durable idea, "a stroke is samples over declared channels", is copied into the Gamma schema. Not an interchange target. |
| **Xournal++ `.xopp`** | Xournal++ (Linux/Windows/macOS), the open-source PDF annotator people actually use with pen tablets | gzipped XML document: pages with a `<background type="pdf" filename= page=>`, `<layer>`s, `<stroke tool= color="#RRGGBBAA" width="w0 w1 w2 …">x y x y …</stroke>`; pressure is stored as *per-point widths* (first value = base width), `capStyle`, dash `style`, `fill`, audio `ts`/`fn` | Pressure as widths; time only as an audio offset | Worth an **importer** (people migrate from it, and it is the only open document-level format with a PDF background). Not a storage model: it is a whole notebook, not a block. |
| **PDF `/Ink` annotation** (ISO 32000) | Every PDF app: Acrobat, PDF Expert, Xournal++ export, Zotero 7's reader (ink tool + import), GoodNotes/Notability when exporting with annotations | `/InkList [[x y x y …] …]` polylines in PDF user space, `/BS /W` constant width, `/C` colour, `/CA` opacity, `/Contents` note; private keys allowed | None (constant width) | **The interchange format.** Export to it (Gamma already writes `/Highlight` and `/Square`), import from it (since built: `pdf_export.py` writes `/Ink`, and a PDF's own `/Ink` annotations import as ink groups, `ink.py`). Pressure is lost unless the writer stashes its own data in a private key. |
| **tldraw draw shape** | tldraw SDK, Logseq whiteboards | JSON record: `segments[{type: free|straight, path: delta-encoded base64 of (x,y,z)}]`, `isPen`, `isClosed`, style enums (`color`, `size`, `dash`, `fill`), `scale` | z = pressure; no time | Good engineering reference: compact delta encoding, a "real pen vs simulated pressure" flag, record-level collaboration (property LWW) that matches Gamma's op model. Its style enums are tldraw's; not a file people exchange. |
| **Excalidraw `freedraw` element** | Excalidraw, the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin | JSON element: `points[[x,y]]`, `pressures[]`, `simulatePressure`, `strokeOptions{variability, streamline}`, `strokeColor`, `strokeWidth`, `opacity` | Pressure; no time | Same lesson as tldraw: keep raw points + pressure, render with perfect-freehand, never store the outline. Whole-scene file, not a target. |
| **reMarkable `.rm` v6** | reMarkable tablets; parsers `rmscene`, `rmc` | Binary CRDT scene tree; `Line{tool, color, thickness_scale, points[{x, y, speed, direction, width, pressure}]}`, 24 pen variants | Pressure, tilt-derived width, speed | Niche importer at most (via `rmscene`). Shows what a *rich* per-point channel set looks like when a device owns the pen. |
| **Apple PencilKit `PKDrawing`** | iPadOS apps | Opaque "Apple Drawing Format" bytes; the API exposes `PKStroke{path: [PKStrokePoint{location, timeOffset, size, opacity, force, azimuth, altitude}], ink, transform}` but the serialisation is undocumented and version-gated (iOS 17 inks fail to decode on older OS) | All, but only inside Apple code | Never as a source of truth: cannot be read on the server, in a browser, or on any other device. The fork's whole derived-asset pipeline (PNG previews, per-stroke PNGs) exists only because of this. |
| MyScript JIIX, OneNote, Notability, GoodNotes | Proprietary | JSON (JIIX) or closed | n/a | No public reader; ignore. |

**Conclusion.** No open format is both a good *storage* unit for a block and
something other software exchanges. The two roles split cleanly: store raw
samples in Gamma's own small JSON schema (borrowing InkML's channel idea and
Excalidraw/tldraw's raw-points-plus-pressure rule), and exchange through PDF
`/Ink` (universal), SVG (rendering), and a `.xopp` importer (migration).

## Rendering pressure strokes

**perfect-freehand** (MIT, ~2 kB, by tldraw's author) turns `[x, y, pressure]`
samples into a closed outline polygon; options `size`, `thinning`,
`smoothing`, `streamline`, `simulatePressure`, start/end taper. Excalidraw,
tldraw and most web ink apps use it. Its README's rule is the storage rule:
*store input points, never the outline*, so strokes stay editable and the
renderer can improve. The outline is one SVG `<path>` (or a canvas `Path2D`)
per stroke; page-unit coordinates plus a CSS `transform: scale()` make zoom
free, exactly how pdf.js's text layer is scaled in Gamma's viewer already.

pdf.js ships its own `InkEditor` (`AnnotationEditorType.INK`), but it lives
inside pdf.js's `PDFViewer` / annotation-editor layer, which Gamma's custom
viewer does not use; its serialisation targets `/Ink` (constant width). It is
a reference for the pointer plumbing, not a component to embed.

## Stylus input per platform (browser)

The W3C Pointer Events API is the one input path that covers every platform
Gamma runs on: Chrome/Edge/Firefox on Windows/Linux/macOS (Wacom, Surface
Pen, Huion), Electron (the desktop app), Android Chrome, and Safari on
iPadOS with Apple Pencil.

- `pointerType` = `pen` | `touch` | `mouse`; `pressure` (0..1), `tiltX/Y`,
  `twist`; `buttons & 32` is the eraser end (Surface/Wacom), `buttons & 2`
  the barrel button. `setPointerCapture` keeps a stroke alive off the
  element.
- `getCoalescedEvents()` yields the full sample rate between frames on
  Chromium and Firefox. Safari does not implement it but delivers
  `pointermove` at the Pencil's native 120/240 Hz, so the two paths give
  comparable density. `getPredictedEvents()` is Chromium-only; it is a
  latency nicety, not a requirement.
- Safari + Pencil: pressure and tilt are real; touch and pen arrive as
  separate pointer types, so "pen draws, finger scrolls" is a one-line
  rule. Setting `touch-action: none` only on the ink layer while a tool is
  armed keeps the viewer's pinch-zoom working otherwise.
- Latency: draw the in-progress stroke on a `<canvas>` with
  `{desynchronized: true}` and commit to the retained layer on pointer-up.
  Chromium's low-latency canvas path is what browser ink apps (Excalidraw,
  tldraw, Microsoft Whiteboard web) use.

So a browser ink layer is *the* multi-platform implementation. A native
client is not needed for pen quality; the fork built one because it wanted
PencilKit's look and audio replay, and paid for it with an opaque format.

## What the upstream fork built (amogadget/Gamma v0.4.0)

`docs/design/handwriting-recording-ipad.md` there describes a native iPad
app (PDFKit + PencilKit + AVFAudio) that logs into the Gamma server, embeds
the web workspace in a WKWebView, and syncs ink as blocks. The web side only
*displays* ink. The design went through three shapes (standalone `.note`
bundles, then Gamma-native blocks, then a hybrid app with browser replay),
which is itself a finding: keeping ink outside the block tree created a
second document identity and was abandoned.

Worth adopting:

- **One block per ink group, not per stroke.** A derivation in a margin is
  dozens of strokes; per-stroke blocks wreck the outliner and multiply ops.
  The user starts a new group explicitly ("New Ink"); strokes inside are
  drawing data.
- **Ink is a block**: it sits in the notes tree under the page, its
  `content` is the caption/transcription (what search and AI see), it can
  have children. Text edits and drawing edits must not clobber each other.
- **Canonical page coordinates** independent of zoom, scroll, device pixels
  and rotation, converted at the boundary with an affine map. They used
  unrotated crop-box points; Gamma's existing `pdf_position` convention is
  the displayed page at scale 1 and the PDF writers already map that to
  user space, so the plan keeps *that* rather than adding a second
  convention.
- **Never rewrite the PDF**; ink is an overlay, export is a separate file.
- **One editable source, no derived display asset that can go stale.** They
  learned this the hard way (blurry whole-block PNG, then per-stroke PNGs,
  then budgets and backfill endpoints). With an open vector format there is
  nothing derived to keep in sync.
- **Sidebar marker + jump + brief flash** for locating a group on the page.
- **Per-point time offsets** cost nothing to store and are what makes
  audio-synchronised replay possible later. Their rule "never fabricate a
  time you did not record" is right.

Not adopting, and why:

- PKDrawing as source of truth, PNG previews, per-stroke PNG `.inkjson`
  replay derivatives, the 32 MiB asset caps built around them: all
  consequences of an opaque format.
- A separate endpoint family (`PUT /blocks/{id}/ink|note|audio|replay-preview`
  with `expected_revision`, lost-response retry rules, an outbox) that wrote
  `unified_blocks` rows with raw SQL. This repo's `apply_ops` + op log + page
  socket already give idempotent inserts, property-level patches, ordering
  and live fan-out; a raw-SQL side channel would re-open exactly the
  problems [collaboration.md](collaboration.md) closed.
- `native_note` ancestry validation and "parent must be a PDF page" checks:
  the block-centric direction wants ink on *any* block, not only under a
  PDF page.
- Audio recording/replay: a separate feature; the format leaves the door
  open.

## How Notability sets up writing (survey 2026-09-14)

Notability (Ginger Labs, iPad) is the pen experience Gamma's handwriting
is measured against. Facts below are from Ginger Labs' support articles
unless marked *community* (reviews, reverse-engineering write-ups); exact
point sizes and the default palette's hex values are not published
anywhere found.

**Pen.** Two ink styles: *ballpoint* (constant width) and *fountain*
(width follows pressure), each also as dashed or dotted; pressure is a
toggle in the pen popover ("~"). Widths are 12 fixed sizes per tool, of
which the toolbar shows three slots at a time (keys Ctrl+Cmd+1..3). Colours:
32 defaults plus custom colours (wheel, hex, dropper) in 64 slots, with 8
"fast" custom colours in the toolbar row (Cmd+Shift+1..8). The separate
*Pencil* tool shades: tilt widens, pressure darkens (opacity), still
vector. A *Calligraphy* pen has a flat nib with an angle slider and a
"Stabilization" toggle that smooths jitter. Ink is vector; hit-testing is
distance-to-path (their engineering blog).

**Highlighter.** Translucent, same popover as the pen (colours, 12 sizes,
pressure/dashed/dotted). It renders *behind* the ink (*community*), so pen
strokes keep their colour on top of it. Draw over text and hold to get a
straight line; a long-press on PDF or typed text snaps the highlight to
words (Smart Highlighter), handwriting is never snapped.

**Eraser.** Two modes, *Partial* (the cut segments become independent
strokes with their own width and colour) and *Whole*, plus 12 sizes, all in
the eraser popover. Partial + hold snaps the erased path to a shape. A
setting "Auto-Deselect Eraser" returns to the previous tool after an erase.
Apple Pencil double-tap (gen 2) is configurable: current ↔ eraser, current
↔ last tool, colour palette, ink attributes, or off; Pencil Pro squeeze
adds hold-to-erase. There is no "back of the pencil" eraser.

**Input.** Palm Detection is a setting; with a Pencil active, one finger
scrolls and a toolbar button "disconnects" the Pencil so fingers draw
until the next Pencil touch. Nothing is published on velocity-based width,
min/max ratio or predicted touches.

**Lasso and shapes.** The Select tool is *freeform* or *boxed*; the
selection moves by drag, scales by pinch or handles, rotates by twist; a
tap inside opens Style (change pen type / width / colour / dash of existing
ink), Convert (to text or math), Copy, Cut, Duplicate, Group, Save as
sticker, Delete. Shapes: draw and hold about a second → circle, ellipse,
triangle, square, rectangle, pentagon, hexagon, arrow, with snapping
guides, editable vertices and stroke + fill styling; "Straight Lines" and
"Shapes Detection" are settings. A Ruler stamps lines and snaps nearby
strokes.

**Toolbar.** One movable strip, default order Pen, Pencil, Highlighter,
Eraser, Text, Select, Media, Audio, Hand, Zoom, Tape, Ruler, Laser; tools
can be hidden, reordered and *duplicated* as preset copies (a second pen
with its own colour and size, Cmd+1..9 by position). Each tool's popover
is one colour row (8 fast + palette), one size row (3 of 12) and the style
row.

**File format** (*community*: `.note` is a zip with an NSKeyedArchiver
`Session.plist`). Strokes are flat float32 point arrays with per-stroke
point counts, one width and one RGBA colour per stroke (alpha carries the
highlighter's translucency), and optional per-point *fractional widths*
(the pressure record). Polylines, no Bézier control points. The open
converters draw them as round-capped `M/L` paths and ignore the fractional
widths.

### Against Gamma's ink

| Notability | Gamma today | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| ballpoint / fountain, pressure toggle | Pen or Monoline per pen preset (`markup/MarkupToolbar.jsx`); pressure is also a browser setting, mouse/finger strokes even | dashed / dotted styles |
| 12 sizes, 3 slots shown | 8 widths per kind, each preset holds one | none in effect |
| 32 colours + 8 fast custom | 14 pen / 8 highlighter swatches + a custom colour per preset | none in effect |
| highlighter behind ink | draw order with `multiply` | pen colour over a highlight |
| eraser: partial / whole, 12 sizes, auto-deselect | partial / whole, 3 sizes | return to the last tool |
| draw-and-hold: straight line, shapes | none | hold detection on a still pointer |
| lasso: freeform / boxed; move / scale / rotate / restyle | freeform / box; move, resize, rotate, Color, Width, delete | none in effect (since built: `ink/InkLayer.jsx`) |
| duplicated tool presets, tap the armed tool for its popover | the same: a row of presets, tap again for the options row | reorder by drag, sync across devices |
| stroke: constant width + per-point fractional widths | size + per-sample pressure | same information |

The strip took Notability's shape after a first version (2026-09-13) that
had four fixed tools with a shared colour and S/M/L row: picking a pen and
then a colour is two taps for every switch, and the colour the user set
on the pen was lost when they went to the highlighter and back. A preset
row is one tap per switch and each pen keeps its look.
