# Agent tools

What the library agent's tools do, how each one is used, and the guardrails
around them. The registry lives in `gamma/ai_tools.py`; the surrounding wiring
— scopes, permissions, the tool loop, replay — is in [ai.md](ai.md).

Every tool is one `TOOLS` entry declaring its wire spec, Settings permission
key, allowed scopes, mutating flag, and executor — so arming a chat is one
filter (`agent_tools`), dispatch is one lookup (`run_agent_tool`), and the
in-scope check (`_load_scoped_page`/`_scope_pages`: folder = tag prefix match
via `foldertags.path_within`, page = id equality) is shared by every
executor. When the request names a cursor block (`focus_block_id`) or attached block
chips (`context_blocks`), `agent_system` adds one line each so "this block" /
"these" resolve to ids without a `read_block` round-trip — their text is
already in the context (see "Pointing the chat at notes" in [ai.md](ai.md)).
Folder semantics mirror
[frontend/src/libraryUtils.js](../../frontend/src/libraryUtils.js) via the
shared `gamma/foldertags.py` rules; keep them in sync.

## The tools

| Tool | Permission | Scope | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list_pages` | List pages | folder | List the folder's pages: id, title, attachments (`[pdf]` when the page carries a PDF, `[]` for text-only), folder paths, labels, cached metadata (first author, year, venue), last-update date |
| `read_page` | Read pages | folder + page | Read one page: title, properties, the user's highlights and notes, and — when it carries a PDF — a windowed excerpt of the attachment's extracted text |
| `read_block` | Read note blocks | folder + page | Read a page's notes as an id-prefixed outline — the ids the editing tools take |
| `search_library` | Search library | folder + page | Full-text search over the reachable pages' notes AND PDF text; hits carry a `source` (note hits: block id + page, PDF hits: page number). `search_pdfs` is its deprecated alias (replay only) |
| `rename_page` | Rename pages | folder | Change a page's title |
| `move_page` | Move pages | folder | File a page into a (sub)folder |
| `edit_block` | Edit note blocks | folder + page | Replace one note block's markdown text |
| `create_block` | Edit note blocks | folder + page | Add a note block under a page or block, optionally after a sibling |
| `move_block` | Edit note blocks | folder + page | Re-parent/reorder a note block (with its subtree) |

### list_pages (folder only)

Optional `label` / `folder` / `title_contains` filters narrow the listing, or
`list_labels: true` returns just the label/folder vocabulary with counts —
the cheap way to learn how a library is organized before acting on it.

### read_page (both scopes)

Returns a `page_report_section`: the page's title, a properties line
(folders, labels, cached metadata, web source, attachment), an excerpt of the
attachment's extracted text when the page carries a PDF, then the page's
highlights and nested notes. A page without an attachment returns its notes —
they are its content. `pdf_chars` sizes the excerpt per call, capped by the
Settings → Assistant "Read window" preference (`gamma-ai-read-chars` →
request `read_char_limit`, riding in the scope dict as `read_chars`; default
cap 20 000 — `agent_tools` formats the effective cap into the armed spec so
the model knows what it may ask for). `pdf_page` starts the excerpt at a
1-based PDF page (extract_text's `start_page` — how a `search_library` PDF
hit is followed up), and `pdf_offset` windows onward from there; while text
remains, the excerpt names the next offset, so long documents are read in
successive windows. The `pdf_*` names stay for compatibility; they mean
"attachment text".

### search_library (both scopes)

One query over both FTS indexes for the in-scope pages: the notes index
(`gamma/block_index.py` — refreshed for changed pages before the query, so an
edit made a moment ago is found) and the PDF index (`gamma/pdf_index.py`
`pdf_missing`/`search_pdf` — the same indexes and query rules as
`GET /api/search` / Ctrl+F).
Note hits come first as `- note [block_id] in "title" (page_id …): snippet`
— ids `read_block` and the editors take — then PDF hits as `- PDF "title"
p.N: snippet`. Un-indexed PDFs are kicked to the background indexer and
reported (as are note pages waiting for a rebuild batch) so the model knows
results may be incomplete. The MATCH ANDs every term, so a zero-hit query is
retried with only its longest words and the result labelled approximate —
otherwise the strict query reads as "the pages are silent" and the model
answers from memory. `search_pdfs` (the pre-Stage-2 name) is kept only as a
dispatch alias for replayed chats — see "Replay across turns" in
[ai.md](ai.md).

### read_block (both scopes)

The user's notes as an outline of blocks, every line prefixed with its block
id (`- [id] text`) — the ids the editing tools take, so the agent is told to
call it before any block edit. `block_id` may be a page id (the whole page's
note tree) or a nested block id (that block's own text in full plus its
subtree). Highlight blocks show their quoted passage inline; long child
contents are snipped per line with an explicit "read_block this id for the
full text" marker, and the listing stops at the read-window budget naming how
many blocks were left out. (`read_page` shows the same notes without ids —
context for answering; `read_block` is the editing view.)

### rename_page / move_page (folder only)

`rename_page` changes a page's title. `move_page` files a page into a
(sub)folder — a new path creates the folder, and memberships outside the
current folder are kept. Both are reversible with another call.

### edit_block / create_block / move_block (both scopes, one permission)

The note editors, all under the single "Edit note blocks" permission.
`edit_block` replaces one block's entire markdown text (page roots are
refused — titles go through `rename_page`; editing a highlight block edits its
note text, never the anchored passage). `create_block` inserts a new block
under a page or block, after the sibling named by `after_id` (default: last).
`move_block` re-parents/reorders a block with its subtree — cycle-checked, and
cross-page moves (allowed when both pages are in scope) refuse subtrees
containing highlight blocks, whose PDF anchors are tied to their own paper.
All three touch the page root's `updated_at` (like the editor's autosave PUT)
so the home feed reorders, and their UI actions carry `page_id` (moves across
pages also `src_page_id`) and `block_id` (the edited/moved block, the created
block's new id; `read_block` actions carry it too) — the frontend reloads the
open page's block tree when it was touched and lights the block up, and the
edit/create calls are previewed in the block while the model is still writing
them (see "Watching the agent work" in [ai.md](ai.md)). There is still no delete under any permission: an
unwanted block is emptied or left for the user.

Typical uses: *"rename these to AuthorYear style"*, *"file the readout papers
into a subfolder"*, *"which of these papers measure T1? summarize the
approaches"*, *"where did I note something about bias-preserving gates?"*
(a notes hit with its block id), *"tidy my notes on this page into
sections"* — and in a page chat, *"where does this paper define the
protocol?"* (it searches inside the PDF and quotes page numbers) or *"add a
summary block to my notes"*.

## Guardrails

Deliberately not offered under any permission:

- Deleting anything — pages, blocks, folders, files.
- Editing highlight anchors or flat labels (folder labels change only through
  `move_page`).
- Reaching anything outside the chat's scope — enforced by the server on every
  call, not just by instructions.
- Reaching uploads, share links, settings, or other users' data.

Disarmed tools are not offered to the model, and the server additionally
refuses to execute them if called. Output/argument sizes are capped
(`_LIST_CAP`, `_DETAIL_CAP`, `_ARG_CAP`), and the loop itself is bounded —
rounds and a ≤200-mutation guard, detailed in [ai.md](ai.md).

**Every tool call is shown in the reply** — reads included: listing, reading
and searching render as ☰/📖/🔍 lines; renames, moves and note edits/creates
as ✎/📁/＋ lines — so there is always a visible record of what the agent
looked at and changed (clicking a chip expands the arguments and the output
the model got).
