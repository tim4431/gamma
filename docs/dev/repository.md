# Repository layout and assets

The deployable applications stay at the repository root. Docker, the local
launcher, and desktop release workflows use these locations.

| Location | Owns |
|---|---|
| `backend/gamma/` | FastAPI application, routers, and backend logic |
| `backend/tests/` | Backend tests using temporary data directories |
| `frontend/tests/` | `node --test` tests of the pure modules; `e2e/` the Playwright browser suite (`npm run e2e`, [debugging.md](debugging.md)) |
| `tests/shared/` | JSON cases for rules mirrored between backend and frontend (search normalization, folder paths, the ink and text merges, notebook paper, the mirror's tree rules), read by both test suites |
| `frontend/src/` | React code grouped by function (`editor/`, `pdf/`, `settings/`, etc.), orchestration in `app/`, reused code/assets in `shared/`; [source map](../../frontend/src/README.md) |
| `frontend/public/` | Files copied as-is into the frontend build |
| `cloud/` | The Gamma Cloud account server (`gammacloud` package, `manage.py`, `tests/`, its own Dockerfile and requirements); imports nothing from `backend/` ([cloud_accounts.md](cloud_accounts.md)) |
| `desktop/` | Electron shell and desktop packaging |
| `ipad/` | The native iPad app: Swift host, the bundle entry of the shared JavaScript, XcodeGen project ([ipad/README.md](../../ipad/README.md)) |
| `extension/` | Browser connector, loaded unpacked without a build step |
| `sites/` | The gammapdf.com website: static pages deployed as a Cloudflare Worker; its build copies the branding, demos and screenshot from `docs/assets/` ([sites/README.md](../../sites/README.md)) |
| `docs/dev/` | Architecture, implementation notes, and plans |
| `docs/research/` | Design research: surveys, findings, and the reasoning behind chosen shapes |
| `docs/user_guide.md` | User documentation |
| `docs/assets/` | Documentation images and animations |
| `tools/readme-media/` | README capture scripts, renderers, and recording recipes |
| `design/brand/` | Authoritative Gamma artwork, variant guidance and output provenance |
| `tools/branding/` | Unified asset generation and consistency checks; README and Store layout recipes |
| `tools/*codex*` | Codex plugin packaging, release and installer scripts with their unit tests |
| `plugins/gamma/` | The Codex plugin source (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, the `gamma` skill) |
| `artifacts/` | Ignored local sources and outputs; [retention guide](../../artifacts/README.md) |
| `data/` | Ignored runtime databases and uploads, controlled by `GAMMA_DATA_DIR` |

Desktop-specific developer documentation remains in `desktop/docs/`.
The [frontend refactor plan](frontend-refactor.md) covers what remains of the
App.jsx decomposition.

## Documentation conventions

The [developer guide](README.md) indexes shared architecture and topic docs.
Keep implementation details in the relevant `docs/dev/` file, and surveys and
design rationale in [research notes](../research/README.md). Label plans and
dated inventories so they are not mistaken for the current implementation.
The root `CLAUDE.md` is an ignored local guide for machine setup and general
working rules; shared project documentation belongs here.

The root README is for users: plain headings without emoji or icons, "Read
from any place" first, pictures linked to the matching section of the
[user guide](../user_guide.md), and a "→ Guide:" line per feature section.
Keep its copy consistent with the website and Store listing. Typed text in
generated illustrations uses `branding.typewriter()`; see the
[branding workflow](../../tools/branding/README.md).

## Asset ownership

| Location | Contents and consumers |
|---|---|
| `docs/assets/branding/` | Generated Gamma PDF logo, hero SVG/PNG pairs and README illustrations; edit sources in `design/brand/` and `tools/branding/` |
| `docs/assets/demos/` | README demos as small animated WebP images |
| `docs/assets/screenshots/` | Documentation stills |
| `backend/gamma/onboarding/welcome.md` | The seeded Welcome page ([onboarding.md](onboarding.md)); Docker copies it with `gamma/`, the desktop freeze adds it with `--add-data` |
| `frontend/public/media/icons/` | Favicon, served at `/media/icons/favicon.svg` |
| `frontend/public/media/gamma-scene-light.svg` | The demo server's landing picture: a generated crop of the hero composition |
| `desktop/assets/icon.png` | Electron window and installer icon |
| `desktop/assets/entitlements.mac.plist` | macOS signing entitlements |
| `desktop/assets/appx/` | Microsoft Store package tiles, splash screens, and scale variants |
| `desktop/assets/store/` | Store listing artwork and listing text |
| `desktop/ui/tokens.css`, `desktop/ui/fonts/` | The shell's committed copies of the design tokens and the Latin Inter file; `npm run copy-tokens` in `frontend/` refreshes them ([ui-design.md](ui-design.md#the-desktop-shell-and-the-extension)) |
| `extension/assets/icons/` | Connector toolbar, manifest, and notification icons |
| `extension/tokens.css`, `extension/fonts/` | The Connector's committed copies of the same tokens and font, refreshed by the same command |

Keep generated assets with their consumer so the frontend build and the extension
archive remain self-contained. Edit authoritative brand sources in
[`design/brand/`](../../design/brand/README.md), then run
`node tools/branding/build.mjs`; `--check` validates all published copies in CI.
All marks derive from `design/brand/marks/favicon.svg`; the desktop, plugin, MCP
and extension PNGs are rendered from this same source, with grayscale disabled
connector variants. React SVG components in `frontend/src/shared/ui/Icons.jsx`
and inline shell glyphs remain source code; they are not duplicate image files
to move into a media directory.

The frontend's `/assets/` URL namespace belongs to Vite's generated,
content-hashed bundles. The backend sends those files with an immutable,
one-year cache policy. Unversioned public files belong under `/media/`, sent
`no-cache` with a real `304` on revalidation (`gamma/app.py`) — the favicon,
the web app manifest and the home-screen icons ([ipad.md](ipad.md)).

The static route explicitly sets MIME types for HTML, CSS, JavaScript (`.js`
and `.mjs`), the web manifest and WOFF2 fonts. These must not depend on the
host's MIME table: Windows registry entries can label `.mjs` as `text/plain`,
which browsers refuse to execute as a module. Both desktop sidecars and
Docker use this route. `backend/tests/test_static.py` covers incorrect OS
mappings for hashed assets, public files and the SPA fallback.

The pdf.js worker is one of those hashed assets: `frontend/src/pdf/PdfViewer.jsx`
imports `pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs?url`, so it is always the
installed package's legacy build and is cached like the bundle. Nothing to
copy or check when `pdfjs-dist` is upgraded.
The worker URL also has a stable `?mime=js` query to bypass old immutable
responses cached with an incorrect MIME type before this fix.

## Desktop inputs and outputs

`desktop/electron-builder.cjs` explicitly sets `directories.buildResources`
to `assets`. This lets the packager discover `assets/appx/` and the app icon.
Its application file list includes `assets/icon.png` for the Electron window;
Store artwork and signing inputs do not need to ship inside the application.

`npm run store-art` delegates to the unified `tools/branding/build.mjs` generator,
which refreshes all brand outputs, including `desktop/assets/store/` and
`desktop/assets/appx/`. It uses the frontend's locked Playwright/Chromium, Python 3,
and the hero's system font stack; generation works offline. See the
[brand guide](../../design/brand/README.md).

Generated PyInstaller intermediates remain under `desktop/build/`; frozen
servers, installers, and Store packages go into `dist-backend/`, `dist/`, and
`dist-store/`, respectively. These outputs are ignored. Do not delete
`desktop/assets/` as build cleanup.

## Updating documentation media

The recording instructions and helpers live in [tools/readme-media/](../../tools/readme-media/README.md).
`.claude/skills/readme-media/SKILL.md` is a short entry point to that workflow.
Published assets live in `docs/assets/demos/` and `docs/assets/screenshots/`;
raw captures, workspace exports and QA frames stay in ignored `artifacts/readme-media/`.
Keep the README's
relative image links in sync when renaming media. Existing user-authored links
are not rewritten.
