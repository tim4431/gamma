# Import and export

The ⋮ menu's Import…/Export… dialogs and every pipeline behind them: embedded
PDF annotations, Logseq graphs, Zotero libraries, Markdown export, the notes
typeset as their own PDF, and the annotated-PDF writer. Code: `gamma/routers/imports.py`, `gamma/zotero_import.py`,
`gamma/zotero_export.py`, `gamma/logseq_import.py`, `gamma/markdown_export.py`, `gamma/pdf_export.py`,
`gamma/pdf_notes.py`, `gamma/pdf_document.py`, `gamma/pdf_typeset.py`,
`gamma/note_markup.py`, `gamma/vector_text.py`, `gamma/pdf_glyphs.py`,
`gamma/pdf_image.py`; frontend dialogs in
[widgets.jsx](../../frontend/src/widgets.jsx).

## Importing annotations embedded in a PDF

`/api/import/pdf-annotations` converts annotations embedded in the PDF file
(SumatraPDF/Acrobat/Gamma-export highlights, notes, and /Square//Circle → area
highlights) into highlight blocks — idempotent via `properties.imported_annot`
keys; opacity honors the annotation's `/CA` so a Gamma export → re-import
round-trips exact colors; PyPDF2 dict access returns `IndirectObject`s, always
`.get_object()` them.

Because imported annotations would otherwise render twice (pdf.js paints them
into the canvas AND the blocks draw as overlays), the Settings → Reading → PDF
viewer → "Annotations inside the file" preference either hides them viewer-side
(`annotationMode: DISABLE`, default) or sends `strip: true` so the import
rewrites the stored PDF without them (the ⋮ menu's "Import…" dialog can
override that for one run; the auto-import on open always follows the
preference); stripped blocks get `properties.annot_stripped`, which tells
`/export-pdf` to write them again (it skips `imported_annot` blocks only while
the original is still embedded).

## The Import dialog

The ⋮ menu's single "Import…" entry → `ImportDialog` in `widgets.jsx`: the
export dialog's counterpart — pick a source (annotations embedded in this PDF,
a Logseq .pdf + .edn, a Zotero library .zip, Markdown notes — one `.md` or a
`.zip` such as a Notion export, or a Gamma export .zip), flip the strip switch (applies
to embedded annotations, including the ones inside Zotero's exported PDFs),
confirm. Zotero is the default source (a numbered step guide reusing
settingsKit's `Step`); with a PDF open, that PDF's own annotations win. Nothing
is remembered: the switch starts from the Settings preference each time, so the
setting stays the standing policy.

## Plain Markdown uploads

The add menu's file picker, directory picker, and whole-window file drop all
accept `.md` / `.markdown` alongside PDFs, and the Import dialog's "Markdown
notes" source takes one `.md` too. `POST /api/import/markdown` decodes
UTF-8 (5 MB cap), reduces any browser-supplied relative upload path to its
filename leaf, uses a YAML-frontmatter `title` or that filename's stem as the
note-page title (a front-matter `folder:` files the page below the upload's
folder), and converts the document into nested Gamma blocks through
`gamma/markdown_import.py`. Headings and indented lists retain hierarchy;
paragraphs, fenced code, math and other Markdown stay as raw block content for
the normal editor renderer. Lines indented under a list item continue that
item — directly below it, or after a blank line when aligned with the item's
text — which is how the Markdown export writes a multi-line block (a fence or
`$$` opened that way swallows its lines, blank ones included); text indented
deeper after a blank line becomes a child block, which is how Notion exports a
toggle's content. In mixed folder uploads, Markdown note pages and PDF pages
receive the same subfolder labels; unsupported files are skipped.

## Markdown zips: Notion exports, Gamma exports, zipped notes

`POST /api/import/markdown-zip` (Import dialog → "Markdown notes", pick a
`.zip`; `gamma/markdown_zip_import.py`) turns a zip of `.md` files into one
page per file. One logic covers Notion's Export → "Markdown & CSV" (with
subpages), Gamma's own Markdown export and any zipped folder of notes,
because the three only differ in naming conventions:

- **Title**: front-matter `title`, else the leading `# H1` (stripped from
  the body — Notion and Gamma both write one), else the filename with
  Notion's `Title <32-hex id>` suffix removed.
- **Folders**: directories become folder labels, ids stripped. Notion puts
  a page's subpages (and its images) in a folder named after the page, so
  the Notion page tree becomes the folder tree. A front-matter `folder:`
  wins over the directory; the dialog's target folder (the open library
  folder) prefixes everything. One common root directory (a zipped folder)
  and Notion's `Export-<uuid>/` wrappers are dropped; Notion's `Part-N.zip`
  members (big exports) are read in place.
- **Links**: a relative link to another `.md` in the zip becomes a
  `[[page]]` mention of the page it produced (Notion's percent-encoded
  `[Sub](Parent%20<id>/Sub%20<id>.md)`, Gamma's `[label](Page-id.md)` and
  `*(from [title](file.md))*` alike); a link or image pointing at a bundled
  file uploads it (`store_file`, content-hash dedup, storage limits per file
  — an over-limit file is a warning and the link stays as typed) and points
  at `/api/uploads/…`. Other links stay as typed.
- **Notion specifics**: a database `Name <id>.csv` becomes a page holding
  the table (`_all.csv` preferred when both exist — it has every row; capped
  at 500 rows × 40 columns) and its row pages `Name <id>/Row <id>.md` land in
  the folder of that name; `<aside>` callouts become `> [!info]` callouts;
  the row pages' `Property: value` lines stay as text.
- **Gamma specifics**: the front matter's `source:` restores the PDF when it
  is bundled (`assets/<sha>.pdf` → `doc_id`/`source_url`, the page becomes a
  paper again) or the remote URL when it isn't; `doi`/`authors`/`year` →
  `properties.meta` (`source: manual`), the ```` ```bibtex ```` block →
  `properties.bibtex`. Highlights come back as their quote blocks, not as
  positioned highlights — the Gamma format (`?mode=gamma`) is the lossless
  route; Markdown is for notes and for other apps.
- **Idempotent**: a `.md` already imported (same bytes — `markdown_import`
  digest — or the same `notion_id`) is skipped, and links to it resolve to
  the existing page, so re-importing an export adds nothing.

The report (`pages_created`, `pages_skipped`, `assets_stored`,
`links_resolved`, `notion`, `pages`, `warnings`) feeds the status line;
warnings go to the browser console. To make the round trip work the
Markdown export writes the page's folder label into the front matter
(`folder:`), relative to the exported folder — a folder export's root pages
carry none — so importing the zip into a folder rebuilds the same tree there.

## Zotero library import

`POST /api/import/zotero` (⋮ → Import… → Zotero library): a zip of Zotero's
File → Export Library → "Zotero RDF" (with Export Files/Notes).
`gamma/zotero_import.py` parses the RDF (items, journal records carrying the
DOI, collections, tags, HTML notes) and tolerant zip-name lookup
(cp437-mojibake, NFC/NFD, backslashes); the endpoint in `routers/imports.py`
uploads PDFs (dedup + quota per file, over-quota items are skipped not fatal),
upserts pages keyed by file hash then `properties.zotero_key` (re-exports
change bytes — Zotero re-embeds annotations at export time), maps
collections→folder labels (optional `folder` prefix form field),
tags→`category`, notes→child blocks (`properties.zotero_note`), then runs the
shared `import_embedded_annotations` (reader annotations arrive inside the
exported PDFs; `strip` follows the client's embedded-annotations preference).
Merging only fills gaps: existing meta/bibtex/files are kept, labels union.

## Zotero RDF export

The import's exact inverse (`gamma/zotero_export.py`, endpoint branches in
`routers/export.py`): `?mode=zotero-rdf` on `/pages/{id}/export` and
`/folders/export` builds a `<slug>/<slug>.rdf` + `<slug>/files/<n>/<name>.pdf`
zip that Zotero's File → Import reads (unzipped) and Gamma's own
`/api/import/zotero` accepts as-is. Element shapes mirror what Zotero itself
writes and `parse_zotero_rdf` reads: venue/volume/DOI on a standalone
`bib:Journal` referenced by `dcterms:isPartOf`, notes as `bib:Memo` HTML
(top-level non-highlight subtrees, one note each — the inverse of the import's
notes→child-blocks mapping), folder labels as the `z:Collection` tree (a folder
export confines them to paths under the exported folder), tags as `dc:subject`,
`properties.zotero_key` reused as `rdf:about` so keys survive a round trip.
Attachment paths live in `z:path` like Zotero's own export — never an
`rdf:resource` *element*, an RDF/XML syntax term that Zotero tolerates but
strict parsers (rdflib) reject. The pipeline is verified against a live Zotero
via its connector server's `/connector/import` (same translator code path as
the wizard). Zotero cannot read the .zip itself — its wizard reports
"unsupported format" for one, so the zip ships a README.txt telling people to
extract and pick the .rdf, and the export dialog shows a numbered step guide
for the format. Pasted note images: embedded in the Memo HTML as data URIs
(Zotero's note import keeps them — verified live; `_EMBED_IMAGE_CAP` guards
size), attached to the item as image `z:Attachment`s when bundling, and
replaced by a plain `(image: … — see item notes)` placeholder in annotation
comments (`strip_image_md`) — comments come from the PDF's `/Contents` and can
never render a picture, so a highlight whose notes carry images ALSO becomes
its own Memo with a page+quote header (`highlight_memo_html`). `/api/folders/export` (all modes) reports per-page
progress through `/api/folders/export-progress`, which the frontend polls into
the status pill during folder exports. Highlights are not in the RDF
— like Zotero's "Include Annotations" they're burned into the exported PDF
copies with `pdf_export.annotate_pdf` (`highlights=0` skips that, `pdf=0`
omits the files entirely, `notes=0` the Memos).

## The export framework

`/pages/{id}/export` and `/folders/export` share one driver (`_run_export` in
`routers/export.py`): it walks the selected pages exactly once (subtree fetch
→ `build_tree` → progress bookkeeping) and feeds each page to a per-format
`_Builder` (`_MarkdownBuilder`, `_NotesPdfBuilder`, `_LogseqBuilder`,
`_ZoteroBuilder`, `_GammaBuilder` — keyed by `?mode=`), which accumulates zip
parts and names the download. `begin(conn, root_ids)` shows a builder the
whole export set before the walk — the DB connection is closed by the time
`response()` runs. Adding an export format = adding a builder; the
endpoints, progress plumbing and `_zip_response` stay untouched. A builder
whose download isn't a zip overrides `response()` instead (`_NotesPdfBuilder`
returns one PDF).

## Gamma-to-Gamma export

`?mode=gamma` (`_GammaBuilder`): a *scoped account backup* in the same
`gamma-backup-1` layout as `/api/export` — a `pages.db` holding just the
selected page subtrees verbatim (same block ids), a `data.db` with their AI
chats (plus the folder view's own `home:<path>` chat buckets on a folder
export), `uploads/` with just the referenced files (doc_id PDFs + anything
matching `UPLOAD_RE` in content/properties — the orphan-cleanup reference
rule), and a `manifest.json`. **There is no new import code**: any Gamma
imports it through the existing `/api/import-data?mode=merge` — additive,
deduped by block id / doc id / content hash, so re-importing adds nothing. The
⋮ Import dialog's "Gamma export (.zip)" source feeds the zip to that endpoint
via the same upload/progress path as Settings → Restore backup (guests can't
import). The dialog's three switches don't apply — a Gamma export is a 1:1
copy, so they're pinned on.

## The Export dialog

The ⋮ menu's single "Export…" entry → `ExportDialog` in `widgets.jsx`: one
Notion-style dialog — format (PDF / Notes as PDF / Markdown / Logseq graph /
Zotero RDF / Gamma) plus Highlights, Notes and Bundle-the-files switches (per-format hint
text lives in the `EXPORT_SWITCH_TEXT` table), remembered in `localStorage`
(`gamma-export-opts`). The switches are query flags on two endpoints:
`/pages/{id}/export?mode=readable&highlights=&notes=&pdf=` (Markdown,
`render_readable` in `markdown_export.py`; dropping highlights keeps a
highlight block's own text as a plain bullet; the front matter carries the
page's folder label relative to the exported folder so the zip re-imports
into the same tree; image sizes export in the
Obsidian dialect — `obsidian_image_sizes` rewrites any legacy `{:width N}`
to `![alt|N](url)`. Block links resolve against the export set
(`resolve_block_links` + `_MarkdownBuilder.begin`'s page-id → filename map):
a `[[ref]]` or PDF link region whose target page is in the same export
becomes a relative link to that page's .md — so a folder zip is
self-contained — and reads as plain text otherwise; a `![[embed]]`
materializes the synced block's content with a *(from …)* attribution,
nested embeds degrading to mentions; ids the resolver doesn't know stay as
typed) and
`/pages/{id}/export-pdf?highlights=&notes=`. "PDF" is the paper itself and is
hidden when there is none (a note page, an unsaved proxy PDF, a folder) —
"Notes as PDF" (`?mode=notes-pdf`) takes over as the fallback format, and its
Bundle switch is hidden because a document always embeds its images. Two
combinations are special: a
Logseq graph is defined by carrying both layers, so its switches are pinned on
and disabled; a PDF with both off is the stored file itself, which the frontend
downloads from the viewer's own URL (so it also works for a PDF that only
exists behind the proxy).

The dialog can also target a whole folder: opened from home with a folder open
(the ⋮ Export… entry) or from a folder card's context menu (`exportFolder`
state in App.jsx), it drops the single-PDF format and sends the same
format/switch flags to `/folders/export?name=` (readable, `logseq-graph` or
`zotero-rdf`).

## Notes as a PDF document

`?mode=notes-pdf` on both export endpoints (`_NotesPdfBuilder` →
`gamma/pdf_document.py`) typesets the *notes themselves* as a new PDF — the
inverse of the annotated export below, and the only PDF a page without a paper
can produce, so the Export dialog offers it everywhere (a folder export puts
every page in one document, each starting on a fresh sheet).

Each block's markdown is parsed twice: into chunks (headings, paragraphs,
`>` quotes and `> [!type]` callouts, list items, `- [ ]` todos, fenced code,
`---` rules, GFM tables, images — honoring the editor's size, Obsidian
`![alt|300]` or legacy Logseq `{:width N}`, capped at the column —
`![[embed]]` synced blocks, `$$…$$` math) and each
chunk's text into styled inline spans (bold, italic, `code`, strike,
`==mark==`, `[[refs]]`, links, `$…$` math). Highlights become quoted passages
with a bar in the highlight's own colour and a `p. N` marker, and the
Highlights/Notes switches mean exactly what they do in the Markdown export
(drop highlights and a highlight block keeps its own writing as a plain
bullet). Links become real `/Link` annotations, page titles and headings
become PDF bookmarks. Layout constants (A4, margins, sizes) live at the top of
the module.

Tables draw as a real grid: column widths measured from the cells (squeezed
proportionally into the column when too wide), wrapped cells, `:---:`
alignment honored, the header bold on a tint and repeated when a page break
falls inside the table. Fenced code is a bordered tinted card, one card
segment per page it spans. `[[refs]]` and `![[embeds]]` resolve through a
`resolve_ref` callback (`_block_ref_resolver` in `routers/export.py` — its own
sqlite connection, since the request's closes before `response()` runs): a ref
reads as its target's first line in link colour, an embed renders the synced
block's content as a card with a soft bar and a muted `from <page>` source
line (nested embeds degrade to refs so transclusion can't recurse).

Pagination is per line, not per block: the canvas breaks a page between lines
so nothing is ever clipped, and code lines carry their leading whitespace as an
x offset because wrapping drops spaces at the start of a line.

## The shared typesetting engine

`gamma/pdf_typeset.py` is what both PDF writers draw with — font choice per
character (Helvetica in four styles, Courier, Symbol, the non-embedded
STSong-Light CID font), AFM widths, span resolution through `vector_text`,
tokenizing, wrapping and the content-stream operators. Spans are
`(kind, payload, level, style)`; `style` is a `Style(bits, href)`, so the note
boxes pass `PLAIN` and the document passes emphasis and link targets through
the same layout code. Everything is laid out in the y-down display frame and
flipped into user space by one `cm`. `pdf_image.XObjectStore` is the shared
upload → image-XObject registry.

## Annotated-PDF export

`/api/pages/{id}/export-pdf`: highlights become standard `/Highlight` (or
`/Square` for area notes) annotations with the note text in the popup
(`gamma/pdf_export.py`) — `?highlights=0` skips that layer entirely. Every
`/Square` carries an `/NM` id (`Zotero-<key>`, deterministic from the block
id): Zotero's pdf-worker maps `/Square`→image annotation but silently DROPS
one without an id, while `/Highlight` imports id-less — without `/NM`, area
notes vanish in Zotero.

### Notes drawn on the page

`?notes=1` adds a second layer from `gamma/pdf_notes.py` — every non-empty note
is *drawn on the page*, in the nearest patch of empty space, with a leader line
back to its highlight. Free space comes from pdfium page-object bounds
rasterized into an occupancy grid (display space, top-left origin, /Rotate
applied — same frame the viewer stores rects in) with a summed-area table
behind the candidate search; already-placed boxes are marked occupied so notes
never collide.

Notes are markdown, so `gamma/note_markup.py` splits each one into text spans
(`(TEXT, str, level)`, level ±1 = real super/subscript), inline-math spans,
display-math items and image items first; markdown emphasis/links/code are
stripped.

### Vector text (math and CJK) → Type 3 fonts

`gamma/vector_text.py` lays out what the base-14 fonts can't: `math()`
typesets LaTeX with ziamath, `glyphs()` shapes CJK per character with ziafont
(a *plain .ttf* — ziafont can't open the .ttc collections most CJK font
packages ship, hence `fonts-droid-fallback` in the Dockerfile; without it CJK
falls back to the non-embedded CID font, which pdf.js renders as latin
gibberish). Both return a `Drawing`: the **glyph placements** (which ziafont
glyph, standing for which character, at which baseline point and size) and,
separately, path ops for the non-glyph shapes (fraction bars, radical
vincula, `\boxed{}` frames). ziamath is never asked for SVG — a flattened
`<path>` has lost the glyph's identity — but for its layout tree, which
`_walk` traverses exactly as ziamath's own `draw()` would (`nodexy` offsets,
phantoms skipped, stretched delimiters split into the MATH-assembly parts
they are built from); only the bar/box/strike leaves draw into a scratch SVG
that becomes path ops. `_paint` honours each shape's `fill`/`stroke`/`fill-rule`:
`\boxed{}` is a *stroked, unfilled* rect, and painting it solid turns the whole
equation into a black slab. SVG's y-down axis matches the display frame, so
positions drop in with a translate/scale; inline math and CJK sit on the text
baseline, `$$…$$` gets a centred row, and a box that had to shrink an
equation or picture loses to a wider candidate.

`gamma/pdf_glyphs.py` turns the placements into text. One `GlyphFonts` per
document builds **Type 3 fonts** — fonts whose glyph programs are PDF path
operators — from the same outlines: each distinct glyph is one `CharProc`
stored once per document (in the source font's own units, `FontMatrix` =
1/unitsPerEm, so one program serves every size), `Widths` come from the font's
advances, and a `/ToUnicode` CMap maps each code back to the character the
layout said it drew (the font's cmap as fallback), so the equation is
selectable, searchable and copies out as `α`, `∑`, `x`. `draw()` emits the
glyphs of a drawing as `Tf`/`TJ` runs — consecutive glyphs on one baseline
become a single `TJ` whose adjustments carry the exact layout positions — and
allocates codes as it meets new glyphs; a font takes 255 codes (single-byte),
then a second resource (`GmT30`, `GmT31`, …) opens. Font dictionaries are
allocated as indirect objects up front so pages (including the overlays
`pdf_notes` merges mid-way) can reference them, and `finalize()` fills them
in before the writer serialises — both writers call it last. Glyph programs
use `d1` (shape-only), so they take the fill colour in force where they are
shown. Nothing is rasterised and no font file is shipped; compared with
drawing every occurrence as filled paths the file shrinks (a repeated glyph
costs two bytes) and the text layer appears; every writer that draws MATH
spans owns a `GlyphFonts`, there is no path-only fallback.

Known upstream limit: ziamath 0.13 stretches `\left(…\right)` around a
`\sum`/`\int` with a runaway MATH-assembly (hundreds of extender parts, a
parenthesis ~2000 pt tall); `_pieces` refuses an assembly of more than
`MAX_ASSEMBLY_PARTS`, so such an expression takes the text fallback instead
of a page-tall bracket. When ziamath is missing or chokes,
`note_markup.latex_spans` falls back to a unicode approximation
(`\frac{a}{b}` → `a/b`, unknown commands keep their name so `\sin` works) —
tests cover both fallbacks.

### Images

`gamma/pdf_image.py` embeds `![](/api/uploads/…)` refs as image XObjects — JPEG
verbatim, 8-bit gray/RGB/palette PNG verbatim too (PDF's `/Predictor 15` IS PNG
row filtering), alpha/16-bit PNG unfiltered in Python onto white (hence
`MAX_PIXELS`). A palette's `/Indexed` lookup must be a `ByteStringObject`: as a
text string PyPDF2 re-encodes it to UTF-16 and the picture comes out one flat
colour.

### Fonts and content streams

Text is a hand-built content stream merged with `merge_page` using three fonts
every viewer has: Helvetica (WinAnsi), Symbol (Greek/math —
`pdf_typeset.SYMBOL` holds codes AND advance widths measured from the font
itself; every `note_markup.SYMBOLS` value must be drawable by one of the three,
which a test enforces), and a non-embedded STSong-Light CID font for CJK —
plus the per-document Type 3 fonts above for typeset math and CJK outlines.
Deliberately no reportlab/Pillow dependency. PyPDF2 leaves merged content
inline in the page dict; it must be re-added as an indirect object or the file
is unreadable. The document writer's page streams and every glyph program are
Flate-compressed (`flate_encode`); the overlay streams `merge_page` produces
stay as PyPDF2 leaves them.
