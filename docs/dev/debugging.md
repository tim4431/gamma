# Running, testing & debugging

## Run it

Backend (FastAPI, Python 3.11+):

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py setup          # idempotent: guest account + missing workspace files
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9001 --reload
```

Frontend (React + Vite):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev     # :5173, proxies /api → 127.0.0.1:9001
npm run build   # outputs dist/ (FastAPI serves it in the Docker image)
```

First run: the app seeds an `admin` account with a random password printed
once to the console (only while zero non-guest accounts exist). User CRUD
also via `python manage.py` (create-user, set-password, set-admin,
rename-user, delete-user, list-users, list-workspaces, set-member,
reset-guest, migrate, backups).

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t gamma .
docker run -p 9001:9001 -v gamma-data:/data ghcr.io/tim4431/gamma
```

## Tests

### Local changes: test the affected modules

Default to the smallest set of tests that covers the changed behavior and its
direct consumers. Do not run the full backend suite, all frontend tests, or
the full browser suite after every edit. Once relevant checks pass, repeat
them only after further relevant changes or when a failure needs investigation.

- Backend changes: select the relevant `tests/test_*.py` files. Prefer whole
  files because tests within a file can depend on earlier tests. For a few
  files, omit `-n auto` to avoid starting a worker per CPU.
- Frontend pure-module changes: invoke `node --test` with the relevant test
  files directly. `npm test` always includes the full module suite.
- UI behavior changes: run the relevant browser flow with `--only`, building
  once after the final frontend edit so the suite sees current code. Select
  a complete flow by its step-name prefix, rather than an isolated dependent
  step. Check that the intended steps actually ran. A pure-module change
  does not automatically require a build or browser run.
- Shared contracts and helpers: include tests for affected consumers. For
  example, changes to shared normalization cases need both Python and Node
  coverage; auth, workspace access, migrations, and block storage may require
  several related suites. Broaden further when the impact cannot be bounded.
- Documentation-only changes: check the diff and referenced commands/paths;
  application tests and builds are unnecessary.

Examples (paths are relative to the indicated directory):

```bash
# From backend/: OAuth behavior and its MCP integration
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_oauth.py tests/test_mcp.py -q

# From frontend/: settings module behavior
node --test tests/settings.test.mjs

# From frontend/: settings UI behavior (build once before the browser run)
npm run build
npm run e2e -- --only settings
```

Report which checks ran and any relevant coverage gaps. Full suites remain
the PR CI safety net in `.github/workflows/check.yml`; run them locally for
broad changes, an explicit request, or unresolved regression concerns.
Selection is manual: there is no automatic changed-file dependency analysis.

### Full backend suite

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # pytest, pytest-xdist, httpx
python -m pytest tests -q -n auto --dist loadfile   # parallel, ~15 s
python -m pytest tests -q                           # serial, ~50 s (simpler tracebacks)
```

In-process API tests (FastAPI TestClient) against a throwaway data
directory — no server, no network: an autouse fixture in `conftest.py`
refuses every non-loopback socket connect and DNS lookup, so a test that
forgets to stub a metadata / PDF / AI fetch fails at once instead of
passing slowly on the network. `pytest.ini` names `tests/`, so a bare
`pytest` from `backend/` works too. The suite runs in parallel with
pytest-xdist: every worker process imports `conftest.py` and so gets its own
throwaway data directory, and `--dist loadfile` keeps each file's tests on
one worker in file order (tests inside a file may build on each other;
files never may). The shared `client` fixture carries the cookie of the last
login on that worker, so a "not signed in" check uses the `anon` fixture (a
fresh client), never `client`. One data directory serves every file on a
worker, so an account name belongs to the module that creates it: prefix
names with the module's area (`bk_admin`, `ca_alice`), create them through
`conftest.make_user`, and pick folder names no other module uses in the
guest workspace. `make_user` fails the run when a second module asks for a
name another module already created. Run them with the project venv's
interpreter (`venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows): the two vector-math
tests need `ziamath` from `requirements.txt`, and a system/conda `python`
without it fails them with "ziamath is not importable" rather than a
puzzling path count.

The AI agent's tests are split by area — `test_ai_tools_registry.py`
(scopes, permissions, the system prompt), `test_ai_tools_pages.py`,
`test_ai_tools_blocks.py`, `test_ai_tools_search.py` (the executors),
`test_ai_wire.py` (provider wire formats, SSE parsing, history replay; pure)
and `test_ai_agent_loop.py` (`/api/ai/chat` with a faked provider) — over the
fixtures in `tests/ai_fixtures.py`. Its `org` fixture creates one account
per test module (the module's name is in the username), so the files never
see each other's pages or provider entries.

Rules the frontend mirrors — search normalization (`gamma/textnorm.py` ↔
`frontend/src/shared/lib/textnorm.js`) and folder-label paths (`gamma/foldertags.py` ↔
`frontend/src/library/libraryUtils.js`) — are pinned by ONE set of cases both sides
read: `tests/shared/*.json` at the repository root, run by
`backend/tests/test_shared_fixtures.py` and the matching node tests. Add a
case there when a rule changes; whichever side drifts fails.

The frontend has **no linter** and no component tests. Its pure modules have
`node --test` tests (`npm test` from `frontend/`, the files in
`frontend/tests/*.test.mjs`): `blockOps` (diff/apply), `collabSession` (the
page session's transport logic over fakes — ordering, reconciliation,
retries, presence, the caret throttle), `sessionState`, `settings`
(navigation, presets), `textnorm` and `libraryUtils` (the shared cases
above), `mdMarks` (the formatting hotkeys' toggle), `logseqPdfModel` (tree
ops), `blockHistory` (the undo classifier) and `menuAim` (the safe-triangle
geometry). A module is testable there when its relative imports carry the
`.js` extension (node resolves nothing else); modules that import React can
still be imported for their pure exports. Actual React rendering and
interactions are exercised by the browser suite below, plus one standalone
browser regression: `npm run e2e:latex` bundles the block
editor with esbuild over an in-memory fixture ([latex_editing.md](latex_editing.md)).

### Browser end-to-end suite

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build                   # the suite drives frontend/dist
npm run e2e                     # ~30 s; exit 1 on any failure
npm run e2e -- --only collab    # steps whose name contains "collab"
npm run e2e -- --continue       # keep going after a failure
npm run e2e -- --headed         # watch the browser
npm run e2e -- --keep           # keep the temp data dir + server.log
```

High-zoom tablet regressions: `npm run e2e -- --only "pdf touch" --keep`.
`GAMMA_E2E_BROWSER=webkit` (after `npx playwright install webkit`) runs the
suite in WebKit. Native touch gestures need Chromium's CDP, so under WebKit
the touch scenario checks only the 400% PDF/ink paint and bitmap release at
tablet dimensions and DPR 2. That is browser emulation, not an iPad measurement.

`frontend/tests/e2e/run.mjs` starts an ISOLATED backend (the project venv's
python — or the interpreter `GAMMA_E2E_PYTHON` names — over a fresh
`GAMMA_DATA_DIR` under the OS temp dir, on a free port, serving
`frontend/dist`), creates the accounts `alice` / `bob`, and drives Playwright's
Chromium (`playwright` is a devDependency; the browser is downloaded once on
first launch). A failed step saves a screenshot of every open page plus the
pages' recorded problems and the server log's tail under the temp dir's
`failures/`, and the temp dir is kept (the summary prints its path). The
`check` workflow runs the suite on every PR and uploads those folders as the
`e2e-failures` artifact. `harness.mjs` holds the server lifecycle, `Account` (session
cookie + `X-Gamma-Workspace` for API seeding, browser contexts logged in as
that account), `makePdf` (a small real PDF with a text layer), and `step()`.
The scenarios live in `tests/e2e/scenarios/`:

- `mermaid.mjs`: note/chat diagrams, streaming fences, editing, source copying,
  SVG downloads, theme changes and Markdown round trips. Run with `--only mermaid`;
  implementation details in [mermaid.md](mermaid.md).
- `mentions.mjs`: paper search, keyboard and touch selection, reference limits,
  persistence, PDF receipts and textarea shrink after clearing context. Run with `--only mentions`.
- `chatNavigation.mjs`: a library or PDF chat reply keeps streaming and is
  saved while the user navigates away and back, before or after it finishes.
  `--only "chat navigation"`.
- `publish.mjs`: publishing a page to Gamma Cloud end to end. A second
  Gamma is started as the share host (`new Server({env})` in `harness.mjs`
  passes `GAMMA_CLOUD_ISSUER`, `GAMMA_CLOUD_POLICY=provision`,
  `GAMMA_CLOUD_SHARE_HOST=1`), and `fakeCloud.mjs` stands in for the
  account server both servers trust: discovery naming the share host, an
  authorization endpoint that answers at once, PKCE code and refresh
  grants, EdDSA ID tokens with their JWKS, `/userinfo`, and the profile and
  server-list endpoints. The account links its identity through the real
  round trip from the share popover, publishes, opens the link on the share
  host anonymously, changes the cloud share's audience, syncs, checks the
  pill and Settings' Publishing row, unpublishes, and stops publishing
  from Settings. `--only publish`.
- `mirror.mjs`: Settings → Workspaces → Clones — the server clones one of
  its own workspaces through the dialog with a write token made via the
  API: Sync, the empty conflicts list, opening the clone, the sync pill's
  log and settings (cadence, detach, reattach), a same-block conflict
  resolved on its row chip, Remove origin ([mirror.md](mirror.md)).
  `--only mirror`.

- `notes.mjs`: New page → title → first block (the seed-block insert),
  Shift+Enter / Tab / Shift+Tab / Backspace, Enter as a line break vs the
  Enter-as-new-block preference, Ctrl+Z, the handle menu, todo checkboxes,
  an uploaded image (its URL must carry the workspace), the workspace
  switcher. Runs in a NON-default workspace on purpose.
- `pdf.mjs`: upload + page by attachment, the viewer's text layer, a
  highlight from a text selection (overlay, quote row, persisted position),
  the find bar hitting page 2, the library card, an AI citation link
  highlighting its quote on the cited page ([pdf_citations.md](pdf_citations.md)).
- `transfers.mjs`: the Import and Export dialogs — format/source cards,
  the review step and its switches, direct export for fixed formats.
- `ink.mjs`: handwriting. The tool strip and its presets, mouse strokes
  becoming an ink block with an `.ink` upload, persistence across a reload,
  the eraser, stroke undo/redo, the partial eraser, a lasso move + delete,
  the notes card's jump + outline, `/Ink` in the exported PDF. Pen input:
  coalesced sample timing, pressure and lift endpoints in the uploaded
  file, prediction, palm suppression and palm-first pen takeover, cleanup
  after `pointercancel` / lost capture. Chromium's native touch and pen,
  and synthetic Pencil events for Safari's handler order. Stylus latency
  and OS palm rejection still need a real tablet.
- `inkEditing.mjs`: tap-to-select and the selection menu. Colour/width
  edits keeping pressure and time, duplicate ids, selective delete, the
  Undo/Redo buttons, a finger lasso-move across groups in pen-only mode,
  swipe/hold arbitration, a pen resuming through a selection, menu
  placement on a small screen, view/edit shares. Native Chromium touch/pen,
  asserting on the persisted stroke files. `--only "ink edit:"`; `--only
  ink` runs both files.
- `guide.mjs`: the first-run guide ([onboarding.md](onboarding.md)) — `?guide=`
  starts a tour and is consumed from the URL, every registered home-view anchor
  is present once, the demo step adds a paper by itself (pointed at an
  uploaded PDF through `gamma-guide-vars`, so no network), the user's
  highlight checks the next step off, Esc leaves and records the dismissal,
  the account menu's "Take the tour" restarts it.
- `ipad.mjs`: the installed web app ([ipad.md](ipad.md)) — the manifest
  and its icons, `theme-color` following the theme, the standalone-mode
  block in the bundled stylesheet (`display-mode` cannot be emulated in
  Chromium). `--only ipad`.
- `pdfTouch.mjs`: 400% rendering under an emulated canvas limit, distant-page
  release/repaint, live ink, native touch swipes ([pdf_loading.md](pdf_loading.md)).
  `--only "pdf touch"`.
- `pdfload.mjs`: PDF loading, in a non-default workspace — the timing probe
  (a 300-page, 20 MB document opened cold at an emulated 20 Mbps, the
  IndexedDB backfill, a warm reopen, a same-tab return; reports the per-phase
  `performance.mark("pdf-<phase>")` stamps and the bytes on the wire as each
  step's note, asserts only that it paints), then the behaviours: page boxes
  from the manifest (a landscape page below the fold), the last-read page
  after a reload, two large documents through the parsed-document cache, the
  anonymous share view by ranges ([pdf_loading.md](pdf_loading.md)).
  `npm run e2e -- --only "pdf load"`.
- `files.mjs`: files dropped on a block row / the page body become file
  chips (a `dropFiles` helper builds a real DataTransfer; the paste step
  builds a `ClipboardEvent` in the page, since Playwright's `dispatchEvent`
  cannot), a PDF chip's right-click "Add to library" makes the document page
  in the project's folder and the chip gets an open-page button, a markdown
  chip's "Add to library" imports a note page and leaves the file untouched,
  the upload endpoint's lab-file / executable rule.
- `collab.mjs`: two accounts in a shared workspace: presence, live ops, edits
  to different blocks, same-block last-writer-wins, undo after a remote edit,
  rename propagation, edits made offline replaying, remote delete, a
  highlight made by the other person.
- `run.mjs`: login, guest access, and refusing an inaccessible explicit
  workspace without opening a different library.
- `share.mjs`: the share dialog, the anonymous share view (PDF, highlight,
  image through the share token, no editor), an edit share.

Every step also asserts that no API call failed (4xx/5xx), no console error
and no page error happened meanwhile (`openPage` records them;
`EXPECTED_FAILURES` in the harness lists designed refusals such as the
metadata fetch's 404 for a PDF without identifiers). Wait for the state a
step needs with `until()` / `waitForFunction` / `waitForEvent`, never a fixed
`sleep` — the one left (the view-only share's "no editor opens") is a
negative check with nothing to wait for. New UI work touching the
save path, workspaces, auth or rendering of URLs should add a step here; the
`/verify` skill runs this suite.

## Debugging surfaces

- **Server log** — Settings → Server → "Server log" (admin only): the
  in-memory ring buffer behind `GET /api/admin/logs`, filterable to
  warnings / errors; the Dashboard above it counts them since startup and
  shows the build and the update check. Backend code must log through
  `gamma/logbuf.py`'s `log` (never `print()`); use `log.warning` for what an
  admin should notice. Secrets are masked at insert time. Gone on restart.
- **Session log + debug tracing** — Settings → Advanced: browser-side event
  log; the "Debug logging" toggle traces reading-position/restore/sync
  events into it and the console. Every PDF load phase lands here as
  `pdf <phase> +<ms>` (ms since the viewer started opening that url) and as
  a `performance.mark("pdf-<phase>")` for devtools' Performance panel — the
  phases and what a healthy open looks like: [pdf_loading.md](pdf_loading.md).
- **Background tasks** — the tasks popover shows every client-side job
  (downloads, uploads, imports, metadata / citation / title / translation AI
  jobs) and the server's indexing (`GET /api/tasks`). A row carries a
  progress bar while the work can measure itself (bytes, translated pages,
  indexed papers) and a stop button (hover) while it can be stopped: the
  viewer's download and the export download abort their fetch, uploads abort
  their XHR, the AI jobs and zip imports abort their request, translation
  halts the engine, indexing asks the server (`DELETE /api/tasks/indexing`,
  which finishes the current paper and skips the rest). A stopped row reads
  "stopped" and ignores the job's own late reports (`cancelledTransfersRef`
  in App.jsx). The client polls `/api/tasks` every 2 s only while the popover
  is open or indexing is known to run; otherwise a 60 s heartbeat, and
  nothing at all while the tab is hidden (one refresh when it comes back).
  Anything that starts indexing (the search panel's library query, the
  Settings reindex buttons) calls `wakeTasks` so the button appears at once
  instead of waiting for the heartbeat. Work started elsewhere (the AI chat's
  own extraction, another tab) shows up within the heartbeat.
- **Status bar** — Settings → Advanced turns the floating status pill into a
  persistent bar under the tabs.
- **Library health** — Settings → Library maintenance lists, per paper:
  metadata state, extracted-text chars, and search-index coverage, with
  per-row retry/reindex buttons plus batch actions: Fetch needed / Refetch
  all for metadata, and Reindex needed (only papers the index is missing,
  holds stale, or hasn't visited — a targeted `/api/search-reindex` with
  `doc_ids`, unlike the Index section's full Rebuild).

## Gotchas worth knowing

- The guest account's data is wiped and re-seeded daily (lazily, in the auth
  middleware) — don't park test data there.
- Slow endpoints (downloads, AI calls, PyPDF2) are deliberately **sync
  `def`** so FastAPI's threadpool runs them; don't convert them to
  `async def` while they hold blocking calls.
- All state is SQLite + files under the data dir (`GAMMA_DATA_DIR`, default
  the repo's `data/`): global `users.db` (accounts, workspaces, memberships,
  shares, personal prefs), per-workspace `workspaces/<id>/pages.db`,
  `data.db`, `uploads/`. Safe to inspect with any SQLite client while the
  server runs; on Windows, open handles lock the directory (matters for the
  migration's moves — stop the server before `manage.py migrate`).
- The server upgrades the data directory at startup (`gamma/migrations.py`,
  snapshot first, log line `[migrate]`) and refuses to start on a directory
  written by a newer Gamma — [migrations.md](migrations.md). `python
  manage.py migrate --status` says where a directory stands.
- Every API call names its workspace (`X-Gamma-Workspace` header from the
  fetch wrapper, `?ws=` on the websocket and in URLs); a 403 "not a member"
  on an otherwise fine request means the tab's workspace is not the one you
  expect — the id is in the URL.
- An AI reply ending in "lost the connection to the server (network
  error)" means the browser→Gamma connection was cut mid-stream, not that the
  provider failed (that comes back in-band as "AI call failed: …"). The
  streams send a keepalive line every 15 s of silence ([ai.md](ai.md)) and
  the server logs `client closed the stream after Ns`; if it still happens,
  a proxy in front of Gamma is closing idle responses sooner than that.
- Timestamps are UTC ISO strings with `Z` (`page_now()`); keep the format.
