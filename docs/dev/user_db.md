# Users, workspaces, databases, and accounts

Where state lives on disk, how a request becomes a user and a workspace, and
everything account-shaped: seeding, the CLI, the admin GUI, storage limits,
the server log. Code: `gamma/db.py` (schemas/paths), `gamma/auth.py`
(middleware + workspace resolution), `gamma/workspaces.py`, `gamma/seed.py`,
`gamma/routers/admin.py`, `gamma/server_settings.py`, `gamma/logbuf.py`,
`backend/manage.py`. The workspace model itself: [workspaces.md](workspaces.md);
schema upgrades: [migrations.md](migrations.md).

## Data directory layout

All state is SQLite + files on disk under a data directory (env
`GAMMA_DATA_DIR`, defaults to the repo's `data/`):

- `users.db` — global. Its `PRAGMA user_version` is the data directory's
  schema version (`db.SCHEMA_VERSION`). Tables:
  - `users` — accounts (bcrypt), the guest/admin flags, nullable per-user
    storage-limit overrides, `default_workspace` (the personal workspace).
    `is_guest = 1` rows are throwaway guest accounts (`guest-<8 chars>`,
    empty hash) that `gamma/guests.py` mints per guest login and deletes
    `guest_ttl_hours` after their `created_at` ([guests.md](guests.md));
  - `sessions` — session tokens, with `via` (`cloud` for one a Gamma Cloud
    sign-in minted, else empty); `guest_date` is written with a guest
    session's creation date and read by nothing;
  - `identities` — the Gamma Cloud identity linked to an account
    (`provider`, the account server's `subject`, `username`, `email`, the
    last verified `claims` — username, plan — the Fernet-encrypted
    `refresh_token` and `revoked_at`, when the account server last refused
    that grant); one per account and provider
    ([cloud_accounts.md](cloud_accounts.md));
  - `workspaces` (`id`, `name`, `created_by`, `kind` personal/shared,
    `access` private/public, `public_role`, `quota_mb`) and
    `workspace_members` (`workspace_id`, `username`, `role`
    owner/editor/viewer — a personal workspace has exactly its account);
  - `pending_memberships` — shared-workspace invitations by Gamma Cloud
    username, keyed by workspace and cloud `subject`, waiting for that
    person's first sign-in ([workspaces.md](workspaces.md) "Pending
    invitations");
  - `shares` — share links, one per `(workspace_id, page_id)` or per
    `(workspace_id, folder)` (the other column `''`), with `created_by`,
    `audience` anyone/users/list, `role` view/edit and the comma-separated
    `allowed_users` ([api.md](api.md) "Shares");
  - `user_prefs` — small JSON values per `(username, workspace_id, key)`:
    workspace `''` for the account-wide keys (`db.USER_PREF_KEYS`: the
    preference `profile`, the active AI provider, the AI provider entries
    and the machine-translation keys with their secrets, the seen notices),
    the workspace id for everything that names its pages (open
    tabs, recents, pinned folders, reading positions);
  - `settings` — admin-tunable server settings (KV), including the
    admin-confirmed `public_url`, the shared AI provider entries
    (`ai_providers`, keys encrypted, [ai.md](ai.md)) and the `cloud_*`
    keys of the cloud sign-in (below);
  - `publisher_sessions` — encrypted publisher cookie snapshots per
    `(username, host)`, imported by the Connector ([extension.md](extension.md));
  - `integration_tokens` — hashed assistant tokens per account and workspace
    (with a `scope`, read or write), and `mcp_oauth` — the OAuth flow's
    expiring records ([mcp.md](mcp.md));
  - `mirrors` — the offline copies of remote workspaces: the local workspace,
    the remote's address and workspace, the write token (Fernet-encrypted
    with the data directory's key), the feed cursors, the last round's
    status and the `page_filter` of a publication ([mirror.md](mirror.md)).
- `workspaces/<id>/pages.db` — the core data model: the `unified_blocks`
  table. Everything is a block (self-referential `parent_id`, fractional-index
  `position` strings like `a0`, `a0V` from the `fractional-indexing` package).
  Root-level blocks (parent `'root'`) are pages; a page may CARRY a PDF
  attachment (`doc_id` / `source_url` / `original_filename`, read through
  `blocks_store.page_attachment()`). Highlights are blocks with `highlight_id` /
  `pdf_position` in their JSON `properties` column; free notes are blocks
  without. Next to it, `page_ops` — the per-page operation log (one row per
  applied batch, `seq` counting up per page, pruned to the newest 2000;
  [collab.md](collab.md)) and `deleted_pages` — a tombstone per deleted page
  (`page_id`, `deleted_at`, `actor`; written by `ops.delete_page`, which also
  drops the page's log rows, cleared when a page is created under the same
  id — so a copy of the workspace can tell a deleted page from one it never
  had), and `sync_pages` / `sync_conflicts` / `sync_log` — a mirror's
  per-page base tree, the merges it decided on its own and what its rounds
  did ([mirror.md](mirror.md); empty in a workspace that mirrors nothing). Open it ONLY through `db.connect_pages_db(ws)`:
  WAL journal mode (readers never wait on a writer — several browsers,
  several members), a 10 s busy timeout, and the schema statements (so a
  restored backup gains `page_ops` and `deleted_pages`). Backups copy it with
  the sqlite backup API, which is WAL-safe.
- `workspaces/<id>/data.db` — the workspace's derived data: AI `chats` +
  `chat_history`, `page_snaps` (the recents-card cover thumbnails, synced via
  `/api/page-snaps` — too big for the prefs KV), the viewer's per-document
  manifests `pdf_docs` (byte size, page count, page sizes —
  `gamma/pdf_meta.py`, [pdf_loading.md](pdf_loading.md)) and the two lazily
  built FTS5 search indexes: `pdf_fts`/`pdf_fts_docs` (extracted PDF text per page —
  schema + queries `gamma/pdf_index.py`, extraction `routers/search.py`) and
  `block_fts`/`block_fts_meta` (every non-root block's content keyed by its
  page root, rebuilt per page when the page changed — `gamma/block_index.py`).
  The indexes are rebuilt on demand; their rows are pruned when pages go.
  Shared by the workspace's members. Personal prefs used to live here (a
  `prefs` table); migration step 2 moved them to `users.db`.
- `workspaces/<id>/uploads/` — PDFs, images and generic file attachments
  (`/api/upload-file`), filenames are content sha256[:24] + extension (dedup).
- `backups/<time>-<label>/` — snapshots of the whole data directory's
  databases (and, on request, the uploads): the migration runner's `v<N>`
  ones (newest three kept) and the ones admins take from Settings → Server
  or `manage.py backups` ([migrations.md](migrations.md) "Backups").
- `backups/workspaces/<id>/<time>-<label>.zip` — one workspace's
  server-kept snapshots (Settings → Backups): `/api/export` zips, full
  copies, at most 20 per workspace, deleted with the workspace
  ([workspaces.md](workspaces.md) "Backups").

Workspace ids are random tokens (`workspaces.new_workspace_id`), so renaming
an account or a workspace never moves files. `db.safe_ws_id` / `safe_doc_id`
guard every path built from one.

## Schema versions

There is no lazy `ALTER TABLE` on connect any more: `db.py` always creates
the current shape, and an existing data directory is brought up to it by the
numbered steps in `gamma/migrations.py` — at every server start, with a
snapshot first, refusing a newer directory. `db.connect_users_db()` raises
`SchemaOutdated` on an old file so nothing reads it with new assumptions.
Content normalization of a workspace's files (`gamma/normalize.py`) runs in
the baseline step and on every backup restore. Rules, versions and how to
write a step: [migrations.md](migrations.md).

## Auth model

`session` cookie → middleware resolves `request.state.user` (+ `is_guest`,
`is_admin`, `default_ws`). A guest account past its lifetime is deleted by
the middleware on its next request (which then runs signed out), or by the
sweeper `gamma/guests.py` runs in the app lifespan every 10 minutes. Both go
through `workspaces.delete_account`, the one account deletion, which the
admin API and `manage.py delete-user` use too ([guests.md](guests.md)).

Which workspace a request reads or writes is a second decision
(`require_ws` / `resolve_ws` / `require_ws_writer` —
[workspaces.md](workspaces.md)): `?ws=` or the `X-Gamma-Workspace` header,
else the account's default workspace, gated by membership and role. Share
tokens grant access to ONE page (any page — paper or plain notes), or to the
pages filed in ONE folder, of one workspace for the audience the sharer
chose: endpoints that support shared views resolve the workspace from the
share token (`resolve_ws` — the token wins over the visitor's own session
for choosing whose data is read) and confine reads to the pages in reach
(`share_scope` + `assert_block_in_scope`); write endpoints require a member
with the editor or owner role (`require_ws(write=True)`), except the block
writers, which accept an `edit` share through `require_ws_writer` under the
same scope. Keep that distinction when touching endpoints. Full
endpoint/auth table: [api.md](api.md).

**Sign in with Gamma Cloud** (`gamma/cloud_auth.py`,
[cloud_accounts.md](cloud_accounts.md)) is a second way to mint a session
row, not a second identity: the callback verifies the account server's ID
token, finds the `identities` row (or links, claims or provisions one per
the admin's policy), inserts the same `sessions` row the password login
does (marked `via = 'cloud'`) and sets the same cookie. The hourly grant
check (`gamma/cloud_sync.py`) deletes those rows, and only those, once the
account server refuses the account's grant. An account the cloud
provisioned has an EMPTY password hash and the password login refuses it.
`manage.py set-password` gives it one. The settings live in the `settings`
KV: `cloud_issuer`, `cloud_client_id`, `cloud_client_secret`
(Fernet-encrypted with the data directory's key), `cloud_policy` and
`cloud_share_host`. A provisioned container takes them from `GAMMA_CLOUD_*`
instead. The same KV keeps `cloud_device_id` (this install's name at the
account server) and `cloud_server_url` (a sidecar's loopback address for the
server list).

## First-run seeding

The APP seeds the first admin, not launcher scripts — `seed.ensure_admin_seed()`
runs at startup and creates an "admin" account (with its personal workspace)
and a RANDOM password printed once to the console (env-overridable via
`GAMMA_ADMIN_USER` / `GAMMA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) ONLY while zero non-guest
accounts exist. Deliberately not keyed on "no admin exists": auto-adding an
admin login to an upgraded multi-user instance would be a backdoor — those
get a startup hint to run `manage.py set-admin`. `seed.create_workspace_files`
writes a workspace's empty files (and the guest welcome page, which names
the guest lifetime); `workspaces.ensure_personal` gives an account its
personal workspace. No guest account is seeded: each guest login makes its
own.

## manage.py CLI

User CRUD: `create-user` (without a password: an account the password
login refuses until `set-password`), `set-password`, `set-admin`,
`rename-user`, `delete-user` (`workspaces.delete_account`: also the
workspaces only that account owned; guest accounts too), `list-users`,
`list-identities` / `link-identity` / `unlink-identity` (the Gamma Cloud
identity of an account, [cloud_accounts.md](cloud_accounts.md)),
`sweep-guests [--all]` (delete the expired guest accounts now; `--all`
every guest), `setup` (idempotent: a personal workspace for every account +
missing files; creates no guest). Workspaces: `list-workspaces`,
`create-workspace <name> <owner> [shared [public [viewer|editor]]]`, `set-member
<ws> <user> <owner|editor|viewer|none>`, `set-access <ws> <private|public>
[viewer|editor]`. Data directory: `migrate`
(`--status`, `--dry-run`), `backups` (list; `--create [--uploads]`,
`--delete`, `--restore`, `--prune`). Every command but
`migrate`/`backups` refuses an outdated data directory. `rename-user`
updates every row that names the account (users, sessions, shares,
memberships, prefs, identities) — no files move.

`set-password` revokes the account's existing browser sessions and integration
tokens, matching password changes through the admin API.

## User management GUI

`gamma/routers/admin.py` (`/api/admin/users*`, `/api/admin/workspaces`),
frontend [SettingsUsers.jsx](../../frontend/src/settings/SettingsUsers.jsx): admins
manage accounts from Settings → Users; non-admins get the same pane as "You"
(their single row from session + `/api/quota`, since `/api/admin/*` is
admin-only). Each account row lists the account's personal workspaces
(from `/api/admin/workspaces`) with Open / Manage — the workspace dialog in
admin mode. Shared workspaces are not per account and are managed from
Settings → Server
([SettingsWorkspacesAdmin.jsx](../../frontend/src/settings/SettingsWorkspacesAdmin.jsx),
on top of `/api/admin/workspaces` + the workspace API, which admins pass
without membership — [workspaces.md](workspaces.md)). Backups are not here: every workspace's
export/import lives on its row in Settings → Workspaces and its snapshots
in Settings → Backups ([workspaces.md](workspaces.md)); admins reach any
workspace from Settings → Server (`/api/export?user=` still serves an
account's default workspace to scripts). A guest's workspace can be
exported but never restored into. Rails: a guest account takes storage
limits and deletion but no password, admin flag or new name; no
self-delete; the last admin can't be demoted or deleted. Deleting an
account (`workspaces.delete_account`) deletes its
personal workspaces and the shared ones it alone owned (the response lists
them); shared workspaces with another owner survive.

## Storage limits

`gamma/server_settings.py`: per-account max upload size (`max_upload_mb`) and
total quota (`quota_mb`, 0 = unlimited); server-wide defaults in the users.db
`settings` KV, per-user overrides as nullable `users` columns (NULL = inherit,
explicit JSON null clears). An account's limits apply to uploads into its
PERSONAL workspaces, and its usage is their `uploads/` directories together
— nothing anyone uploads into a shared workspace counts against a person. A
shared workspace is checked against the server-wide per-file cap and its
own `workspaces.quota_mb` (NULL = unlimited; admins set it in Settings →
Workspaces or Members & sharing). `workspace_quota(ws)` resolves the pair
that applies. `check_upload_allowed(ws, n)` hard-gates `/api/uploads`, `/api/upload-image`,
`/api/upload-file` and the imports (413 over per-file, 507 over quota;
already-stored hashes always pass — dedup adds no bytes); `can_store`
soft-gates best-effort caches (proxy `save=1`, ai_context re-download).
`GET /api/quota` = the request's workspace: the limits that apply,
`used_bytes` (the account's total for a personal workspace, the workspace's
own for a shared one), `workspace_bytes` (this workspace's), and `account`
— the person whose limits these are, "" for a shared workspace;
deliberately NOT part of `/api/session` (identity only). Backup-restore imports are unmetered.
Details + UI in [settings.md](settings.md).

## Server dashboard and log

Settings → Server opens with a **Dashboard** (`GET /api/admin/server-info`,
`gamma/version.py`, [api.md](api.md)): three tiles — the build (`v<version>`
from `GAMMA_VERSION`, stamped by the Docker build and the desktop shell;
"dev build" for a checkout), uptime, and warnings · errors logged since
startup (`logbuf.counts()`) — plus an Updates row comparing the build with
the newest GitHub release (cached; "Check now" refetches; `GAMMA_UPDATE_CHECK=off`
for air-gapped servers). A Docker image built from a push or a branch
rather than a release is `v<tag>-dev.<n>` (`n` commits after the newest
`v*` tag) and also compares against its branch (`GAMMA_BRANCH`): commits
there that this build lacks are an update to `v<tag>-dev.<m>`, the version
that branch's next image carries, with a "What's new" link to GitHub's
comparison. A Docker server cannot update itself, so an
available update only says which image to pull; the desktop app updates
on its own. Things worth an admin's eye are logged at WARNING — a
share-link visitor over the write throttle, an address probing unknown
share links ([api.md](api.md) "Link visitors") — so the tile turns amber
and the log's "Warnings" filter shows them. An admin who never opens the
pane still hears of a newer release and of logged errors: both are notices
(`gamma/notices.py`, `GET /api/notices`), the red dot on the account
button that leads to this pane — [settings.md](settings.md) "Notices".

`gamma/logbuf.py`, `GET /api/admin/logs?after=<seq>`: all backend logging goes
through `logbuf.log` (a `logging` logger — use it, not `print()`), which tees
to the console and a scrubbed in-memory ring buffer (2000 entries, gone on
restart) shown admin-only in Settings → Server → "Log", with a level filter
(All / Warnings / Errors) and a badge per non-info line. Secret-shaped
substrings (Bearer/sk- keys, `password=`/`token=` pairs, 40+-char urlsafe runs
— session/share tokens) are masked at insert time; the one-time seeded admin
password in `seed.py` stays a raw `print()` on purpose and must never route
through the logger. `uvicorn.access` is deliberately not captured (its lines
carry `?share=` query strings); the middleware's `[http]` line covers requests
path-only.
