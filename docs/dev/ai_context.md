# AI context for long papers

How the AI chat gets a page's content, why that used to fail on long papers,
and the measurements behind the current design. Code: `gamma/ai_context.py`
(context assembly), `gamma/ai_tools.py` (agent tools), `gamma/pdf_text.py`
(extraction), `gamma/pdf_index.py` + `gamma/block_index.py` (the PDF and notes indexes;
`gamma/routers/search.py` extracts PDFs into the former).

## What a page contributes

Context is framed as *pages from the user's knowledge base*
(`ai_context.CONTEXT_INTRO` precedes it in the user turn). Each page section
(`page_report_section`) is: `### title`, a properties line (folders, labels,
cached metadata, web source, attachment), and the user's notes tree with
highlights; a page that carries a PDF adds the document's text — for the
chat, the labelled head excerpt below; for `read_page`, a `pdf_chars`
window. A page without an attachment is its notes, always included;
`include_notes` only decides whether PDF pages also show theirs. In the
notes, and in the focus outline of the cursor's and the attached blocks
(`notes_focus_section`), a text box ([text_boxes.md](text_boxes.md)) is a
note, never an area highlight. A label before its text says where it is:
"(text box on p. N)", "(text box on a page of paper)" or "(text box, not
placed on a page)" (`text_box_label`). The nearest sheet above a box wins,
and an outline that starts at a block asks `under_sheet` once.

The head excerpt is the *document part* of the context: it goes on the
oldest user turn and reads the same on every turn of a conversation,
which is what the providers' prompt caches key on ("Prompt caching" in
[ai.md](ai.md)). What a message selects is the *message part*: windows
around the selected passages (placed by page and section, with a picture
of a formula — "Selected PDF passages" in [ai.md](ai.md)) go in front of
that question alone, `SELECTION_WINDOW_CHARS` (10,000) per passage within
the page budget and without the head slice the excerpt already gives
(`selection_context(with_head=False)`), and not at all when the excerpt
holds the whole document. Before, a selection swapped the head excerpt for
its windows, so the conversation's opening changed with every selection
and nothing could cache. Everything below is about the PDF part of a page
and applies unchanged.

## The problem

A page chat injects the first `context_char_limit` chars of the PDF's
extracted text (default 60,000 since 2026-08-28 — Settings → AI → Chat →
"Single paper"; the eval below ran at the old 8,000). A 50-page paper is
~280,000 chars, so at 8k the model saw under 3% of it — and nothing used to
tell it that. Asked for a detail deeper in
the paper, it answered from its memory of similar papers: confident, specific,
and wrong (a camera model that isn't in the paper, n=70 where the paper says
n=53, fidelities off by tenths of a percent). The page-scope agent tools
(`read_page`, `search_library` — then `search_pdfs`) mostly fix this, but
four things still lost facts:
the model didn't know the excerpt was an excerpt, it guessed page numbers, an
over-specific search query returned zero hits (read as "the paper is silent"),
and every page past 400 was silently invisible.

## Measurements

Ground-truth detail questions (string-graded facts, each buried well past the
8k head) against the real `/api/ai/chat` on an isolated copy of live data,
model `gpt-5.6-terra`, page-scope agent with read+search. "Traps" ask for
plausible facts the paper does *not* contain; the right answer is "not in this
paper".

| config | paper 164k/28pp | review 282k/51pp | book 855k/484pp | normal questions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tools off, 8k head | 46% | 48% | — | 100% |
| agent, before fixes | 94% (3.9 calls/q) | 90% (4.1) | 88% (6.0) | 100% |
| + grounding prompt | 100% (3.8) | 94% (4.9) | — | 100% |
| + excerpt label, doc map, search fallback | 100% (3.5) | 97% (4.1) | 92% (9.9) | — |
| + page cap lifted | — | — | 96% (3.3) | — |
| **all shipped (re-run)** | **100%** (3.8) | **94%** (4.6) | **96%** (3.3) | **100%** |

Also tried: 5× larger head context (40k). +3 points for 5× the tokens on every
message, and it doesn't stop fabrication — the tools are the better lever.

## What shipped, and why

- **Grounding prompt** (`_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `routers/ai.py`, plus the
  mechanical tool-guidance lines `agent_system()` appends in `ai_tools.py`):
  anything stated as being *in these pages or their documents* must come from
  text actually read; look it up first, say "not in their pages" otherwise —
  and say whether a fact comes from a PDF (with its page number) or from the
  user's notes. Scoped to claims about the pages — general background stays
  answerable, which is what keeps the "normal questions" column at 100% (an
  unscoped version refused to explain what a transversal gate is). With tools
  off, this converts fabricated answers into honest "the excerpt doesn't say"
  (recall drops to 17% — those were memory, not reading).
- **Excerpt label** (`head_context` / `extract_pdf_context`): the injected
  head is prefixed with `[EXCERPT — the first 60,000 characters of this
  51-page PDF: PDF pages 1–9, page 9 cut short. Pages 10–51 are NOT shown
  below …]` whenever the document didn't fit; `CONTEXT_INTRO` likewise
  says a page's document text "is often an excerpt (see its label)".
  Unlabelled, "here is the text" reads as the whole paper. The same
  coverage reaches the agent prompt (`ai_tools.coverage_lines`: which
  pages are in context, read from the cut-short page on) and `read_page`,
  which never sends a page the excerpt shows in full — before, the prompt
  told the model to look everything up "even if you think you know it",
  and it re-read page 1 of a paper whose first nine pages it had.
- **Page labels** (`extract_text(..., label_pages=True)` in `pdf_text.py`):
  every non-empty physical page is prefixed `[PDF page N]`, counted from
  `start_page` with blank pages included; a `read_page` continuation that
  starts mid-page repeats it as `[PDF page N; continued]` outside the offset
  window (`pdf_excerpt`), and each context section carries
  `Gamma page ID: <id>`. Both feed the clickable citations
  ([pdf_citations.md](pdf_citations.md)).
- **Document map** (`document_map`): for page/folder agent chats, a
  `MAP_BUDGET` (2.4k-char) outline — one line per PDF page (sampled for big
  documents, the step rounded up so the budget holds), taken from the FTS
  index so it costs a query, not a re-parse — starting at the page the
  excerpt cut short (`from_page`; no map when the excerpt holds the whole
  document). Each attached paper gets its own map labelled with its Gamma
  page ID. The model jumps to the right page instead of guessing; on one
  question this cut 6 tool calls to 1.
- **Search relaxation** (`_run_search_library`): the FTS query ANDs every
  term, and agents write 6–9-word natural queries — one word the page doesn't
  use meant zero hits and a wrong "the paper doesn't discuss this". A miss now
  retries with only the longest words and labels the result as approximate; a
  true miss says explicitly "do not answer from your own knowledge". (The
  same relaxation covers the notes index the tool searches since Stage 2.)
- **Page cap raised** (`pdf_text.MAX_PAGES`, 400 → 5000): the old cap made a
  484-page book end at page 400 *everywhere* — not in the search index, not
  reachable by `read_page`, indistinguishable from the document ending. Worst
  case was a search hit on p.410 the agent then couldn't read: 32 tool calls of
  thrashing. The cap survives only as a runaway guard and logs when it bites.
  (`textnorm.INDEX_VERSION` bumped so old indexes rebuild lazily.)
- **Extraction lock** (`pdf_text._lock`): pdfium is not thread-safe — two
  overlapping extractions both die with "Failed to load page", even on
  different files. Sync endpoints run in FastAPI's threadpool and the search
  indexer runs in a background thread, so a chat could collide with its own
  indexing, get the failure sentinel as context, and answer blind. Every
  pdfium call is serialized behind one lock, and every pdfium object is
  closed explicitly inside it, with pypdfium2's finalizers routed through
  the same lock: a page left to the cyclic GC is closed on another thread
  and takes the process down (`pdf_text.py`). The walks over every page
  take the lock per page, not per document, so a chat's extraction runs
  between the pages of a book being indexed instead of after it (measured:
  `/pdf-text-status` during a 5,000-page reindex, 5.6 s → 77 ms). The lock
  is handed over in turn: a bare `RLock` is unfair, and on Linux the walk
  took it back after each page before a waiting thread woke. So a fresh
  taker queues at a second lock (the "door") and holds it while it waits,
  and the walk's next page lines up behind it.

## Known limits

- A leading question about a fact that is *not* in the paper ("what fidelity
  does this review report for X?") can still elicit the remembered number,
  now hedged rather than asserted — the model searches, finds nothing, and
  names the value while admitting it didn't find it in the text.
- The map and index only exist once the paper is indexed. Every chat
  request names a page with a PDF (`gather_inputs` → `ensure_indexed`, for
  each PDF page in context) kicks background indexing for an un-indexed or
  stale paper, so the first message on a fresh paper works without
  map/search and the next one has both. (Before, only a search call kicked
  it — a chat that only ever used `read_page`, or ran with tools off, never
  got its paper indexed.)
- With tools off the model sees only the labelled head excerpt; nothing else
  in a plain chat can reach the rest of the paper (native PDF attachment is
  refused by the ChatGPT-OAuth backend and falls back to that same excerpt).
  Paper chats default to tools off, so the head budget is what most paper
  chats live on — hence the 60,000 default (a typical ~20-page paper fits
  whole; the multi-paper total is 120,000, split evenly across the context
  pages, note pages included). The budgets are characters: 60,000 of
  English prose is ~15k tokens, of dense notation ~20k, of Chinese ~50k
  (`ai_context.estimate_tokens` counts that way for the window fit). The
  truncation is also shown to the user: `head_context` returns the coverage
  (`pages_shown` from `pdf_text.extract_text_pages`, total from
  `page_count`) that the chat streams back as its `context` line and renders
  as a "Model saw pages 1–9 of 22" chip on the reply — with the pages the
  reply's tools read folded in ([ai.md](ai.md)).
- Grading is substring matching on de-markdowned/de-LaTeXed answers; the
  harness lives outside the repo (session scratchpad, `eval/`).
