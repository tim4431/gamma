The layout below describes the current code. The proposed feature folders,
state ownership, and migration order are in the
[App.jsx decomposition plan](../../docs/dev/frontend-refactor.md).

```
main.jsx            React root
App.jsx             application orchestration: routing, autosave, docking, home
libraryUtils.js     pure library/paper rules shared across application views
LoginPage.jsx       loading and login screens
settings.jsx        settings dialog and its papers/AI/search/diagnostic panes
blockTree.jsx       the Logseq outliner — block rows, [[refs]], drag, markdown
logseqPdfModel.js   pure tree ops (insert/indent/outdent/flatten/cycle-check)
pdfViewer.jsx       custom pdf.js viewer — pages, highlights, links, text search; exports COLORS
search.jsx          workspace search (Ctrl+F): SearchPanel popover, fuzzy
                    buildSearchRegex (mirror of backend gamma/textnorm.py)
chatDock.jsx        the AI chat window (self-contained per-page conversation)
widgets.jsx         shared chrome: dock windows, tabs, popovers, markdown, inputs
sessionState.js     localStorage: restore last workspace on bare `/`
utils.js            API base, fetch wrapper, ids, hashing, formatting
app.css             shared controls plus workspace, PDF, blocks, and chat
library.css         home library, folders, file views, selection, and pins
settings.css        settings dialog layout and settings-specific controls
```

## How-tos

- **Label a page** — open the page, click the 🏷 Labels chip → type comma-separated
  labels. Stored as `properties.category`. Search `:quantum:` to filter by label
  (colons let labels contain spaces; `:a::b:` requires both).
- **Highlight** — select text on the PDF → pick a color. Creates a highlight block.
- **Reference link** — right-click a highlight → *Copy as reference point*, then paste
  into a link dialog to point one paper's note at an exact spot in another.
- **Share** — a page's share menu mints a `?share=<token>` read-only public link.
