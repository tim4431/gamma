# Gamma Cloud account server

The service behind `account.gammapdf.com`: accounts, the sign-in portal,
and the OpenID Connect provider every Gamma server (a desktop sidecar, the
free share host, a paid container) signs people in through. It holds no
notes or files and imports nothing from `backend/`.

Architecture and the full reference: [docs/dev/cloud_accounts.md](../docs/dev/cloud_accounts.md).
The product plan it serves: [todos/gamma-cloud-plan.md](../todos/gamma-cloud-plan.md).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python manage.py setup
python manage.py create-account you@example.org you --admin --verified
uvicorn app:app --port 9002 --reload      # portal at http://127.0.0.1:9002
python -m pytest tests -q
```

Configuration lives in two places that do not overlap: the `GAMMA_CLOUD_*`
env variables documented at the top of [gammacloud/config.py](gammacloud/config.py),
and the sign-up gate an admin edits on the Admin page's Settings tab
([gammacloud/settings.py](gammacloud/settings.py)) — registration mode,
Turnstile, blocked mail domains. With the defaults (registration by invite,
mail to the console) `python manage.py invite` prints a code and the verify
link appears in the server log.
