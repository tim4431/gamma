"""Sign-in through an outside provider (``providers.py``): which account an
identity is, linking and unlinking, the account a new person creates, and
the ``external_logins`` rows that carry one sign-in across the provider
round trip and the username form after it.

The browser holds a random token in the ``gc_ext`` cookie; the row holds
its hash. The OAuth ``state``, the PKCE verifier and the nonce are derived
from that token (``derive``), so the row holds nothing replayable and the
state the provider sees reveals neither. The one-tap prompt's nonce is
derived the same way from the ``gc_tap`` cookie.

Which account (``resolve``):

- the identity is linked → that account;
- else the provider vouches for an address an account has
  (``email_trusted``) → it is linked to that account. When that account
  never confirmed the address, whoever chose its password never proved
  they own it: the password is cleared and everything signed out;
- else an account has the address but the provider is not authoritative
  for it → refused, with how to connect it from Settings instead;
- else → nobody: the caller offers the signup form (unless registration
  is closed).

An account made here has no password; ``accounts.confirm_ok`` lets such an
account confirm sensitive changes with its session alone, and Settings
offers to set one.
